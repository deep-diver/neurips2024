[{"figure_path": "Y58T1MQhh6/tables/tables_1_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparison of our regret upper bounds with existing bounds. All bounds assume that loss functions are G-Lipschitz (except Lines 1-3) and x* is on the boundary of K. The upper bounds that contain the variable L > 0 assume ||g1 + ... + gt||2 \u2265 tL for all t \u2208 [T]. We use f\u00b0 = Ef~D[f], C \u2265 0 is the corruption level, and the notation ignores logarithmic factors. The (\u03ba, 2)-uniformly convex set is \u03ba-strongly convex. Theorem is abbreviated as as Thm, Corollary as Cor, and sphere-enclosed as sphere-enc. Note that regret bounds proven in this study can be simultaneously achieved by the same algorithm with identical parameters.", "description": "This table compares the regret upper bounds derived in this paper's work to those found in existing literature.  It shows the regret bound achieved under different conditions (stochastic, adversarial, corrupted stochastic environments), feasible set types (ellipsoid, strongly convex, sphere-enclosed, uniformly convex), and loss function characteristics.  The table highlights the improvements achieved by the new approach proposed in the paper.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
