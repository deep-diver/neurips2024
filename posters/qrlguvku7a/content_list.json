Diffusion models generate samples by reversing pre-defined complicated diffusion processes, thus requiring many inference steps to synthesize high-quality results. Such expensive computational cost hinders their deployment [14, 40, 31] in real-world applications. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "Diffusion models can be efficiently sampled by solving the corresponding probability flow ordinary differential equations (PF-ODEs) [39, 38]. Researchers have designed many advanced samplers, such as DDIM [38], DPM-solver [24], and DEIS [53], to accelerate generation, inspired by the semi-linear structure and adaptive solvers in ODEs. However, these samplers still require tens of inference steps to generate satisfying results. Researchers have also explored distilling pretrained diffusion models into few-step generative models [35, 28, 5, 50, 30, 3], which have succeeded in synthesizing images within 8 inference steps. Progressive Distillation [35] separates the whole sampling process into multiple segments and learns the mapping from starting points to endpoints for each segment. Distribution Matching Distillation [50] and SwiftBrush [30] use the score distillation loss to align the distributions of teacher and one-step student generators. UFOGen [47], SDXL-Turbo [36] and SDXL-Lightning [16] resort to adversarial training for learning few-step/one-step image generators. They initialize the students from pretrained diffusion models and use adversarial and/or MSE losses to align the student model\u2019s generation with the pretrained ones. These methods suffer from the difficult tuning of the adversarial training procedure and the mode collapse issue. Latent Consistency Model (LCM) [26, 27] adopts consistency distillation [40] to train a generator that directly maps noises to the terminal images. LCM only utilizes supervised distillation where the training procedure will be more stable and easier in comparison to adversarial training. However, the generated images have fewer details compared with SDXL-Lighting. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "Unlike the existing methods above, which mainly learn the mappings from noises to images, we aim to simplify the flow trajectories and preserve the continuous flow trajectories of the original pretrained diffusion models. Specifically, we attempt to straighten the trajectories of the original PF-ODEs via a piecewise reflow operation. Previously, InstaFlow [21] leverages the rectified flow framework[20, 19] to learn the transformation from initial random noise to images. It bridges the two distributions with linear interpolation and trains the model by matching the interpolation. With the reflow operation, it may be able to learn straight-line flows for one-step generation via pure supervised learning. InstaFlow provides a simple pipeline for accelerating pretrained diffusion models, however, it suffers from poor sampling quality which can be attributed to synthetic data generation. The reflow operation requires generating data from the pretrained diffusion models with ODE solvers (e.g., DDIM or DPM-Solver [24, 25]) to construct a training dataset. Synthesizing training data brings two problems: (1) constructing and storing the dataset requires excessive time and space, which limits its training efficiency; (2) synthetic data has a noticeable gap with real training data in quality due to the numerical error of solving ODEs. Thus, the performance of the learned straighter flow is bounded. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "To address the problems, we propose piecewise rectified flow (PeRFlow), which divides the flow trajectories into several time windows and conducts reflow in each window. By solving the ODEs in the shortened time interval, PeRFlow avoids simulating the entire ODE trajectory for preparing the training data. This significantly reduces the target synthesis time, enabling the simulation to be performed in real time along with the training procedure. Besides, PeRFlow samples the starting noises by adding random noises to clean images according to the marginal distributions, and solves the endpoints of a shorter time interval, which has a lower numerical error than integrating the entire trajectories. Through such a divide-and-conquer strategy, PeRFlow can straighten the sampling trajectories with large-scale real training data. Besides the training framework, we also design a dedicated parameterization method for PeRFlow to inherit sufficient knowledge from the pretrained diffusion models. Diffusion models are usually trained with $\\epsilon$ -prediction, but flow-based generative models generate data by following the velocity field. We derive the correspondence between \u03f5- prediction and the velocity field of flow, thus narrowing the gap between the pretrained diffusion models and the student PeRFlow model. Consequently, PeRFlow acceleration converges fast and the resultant model can synthesize highly-detailed images within very few steps. PeRFlow does not require unstable adversarial training or a complete modification of the training paradigm. It is a lightweight acceleration framework and can be easily applied to training unconditional/conditional generative models of different data modalities.

Inspired by this observation, we first allocate each window with $N//K$ steps. If $N$ mod $K>0$ , then the extra budget is given to time windows in noisy regions. Specifically, we give one extra step for windows, whose index $i$ satisfies $K-i<N$ mod $K$ .

To accelerate these models, various methods have been proposed. Progressive Distillation [35, 28] iteratively reduces the number of inference steps to 4-8, but the error can accumulate during the process. Alternative approaches [45, 44, 54, 47, 16, 36] leverage adversarial losses to align the distributions and reduce the number of inference steps, but these methods often struggle with training instability and mode collapse. To avoid adversarial training, recent works [50, 30, 56] employ additional models to estimate the score of the generated data for distilling one-step generators, but this adds extra cost to the training pipeline. Consistency Distillation [40, 26] is a novel pipeline for distilling few-step diffusion models by optimizing a consistency loss. However, the substantial difference between consistency models and the original diffusion models can hurt their adaptability to pretrained modules. In our work, PeRFlow provides a simple, clean, and efficient framework for training few-step generative flows. By using different parameterizations as described in Section 2.2, PeRFlow achieves minimal gap with diffusion models, making it suitable for various pre-trained workflows.

Reflow is an effective way to learn such straight flows, but it requires constructing a large synthetic dataset [20, 21], which can introduce computational overhead and distribution shift. To avoid dataset construction,[13, 46] use an extra neural network to estimate the initial noise corresponding to an image, but training this network can be challenging. [33] employs mini-batch optimal transport to directly learn a straighter trajectory, but it is unclear how to apply this method to conditional generation scenarios, such as text-to-image generation. [29] finds the best step-size schedule for the pretrained generative model before reflow to improve efficiency, but it cannot avoid dataset generation and the resulting distribution shift. PeRFlow provides a new method to avoid using synthetic datasets. It uses real training data to mitigate distribution shift and a divide-and-conquer strategy to efficiently perform reflow, leading to advanced few-step text-toimage generators. Sequential reflow[51] is a concurrent work to ours.

PeRFlow also designs proper parameterizations to inherit knowledge from pre-trained diffusion models for fast convergence. Consequently, PeRFlow accelerates powerful diffusion models like SD v1.5, SD v2.1, and SDXL, producing high-quality few-step image generators.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
