Existing algorithms for delayed BCO had a significant gap between their regret bounds and the theoretical lower bound. This gap is problematic because the regret, representing the cumulative difference between an algorithm's performance and the optimal strategy, is a key metric for evaluating the effectiveness of BCO algorithms. \nThis research introduces a novel algorithm, called D-FTBL (Delayed Follow-The-Bandit-Leader). It cleverly incorporates a blocking update mechanism which separates the effects of delays and noisy feedback measurements. The results show that D-FTBL achieves a significantly improved regret bound, effectively closing the gap with the theoretical lower bound. Furthermore, the algorithm shows adaptability in scenarios with strongly convex functions, making it useful in a wider range of practical applications.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "aR9JvkOGjM/podcast.wav"}
