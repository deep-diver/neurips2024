[{"figure_path": "aR9JvkOGjM/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Experimental results on delayed online binary classification for ijcnn1 and SUSY.", "description": "This figure shows the total loss of three algorithms (D-FTBL, GOLD, and Improved GOLD) on two datasets (ijcnn1 and SUSY) for different maximum delays (d).  The x-axis represents the maximum delay, and the y-axis represents the total loss.  The plot demonstrates the performance comparison of the algorithms in a delayed online binary classification setting.  D-FTBL generally shows lower loss than the other two algorithms, especially as the maximum delay increases.", "section": "4 Experiments"}]
