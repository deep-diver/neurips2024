Existing methods for calibration error estimation typically assume either labeled data from the target domain (real-world data) or rely on covariate shift assumptions.  This limits their applicability in many practical scenarios where obtaining labeled target data is expensive or impossible. \nThis research introduces LaSCal, a novel calibration method designed to address these limitations. LaSCal overcomes the need for labeled target data by using a consistent label-free estimator for calibration error. The method is tested extensively, showing consistent improvement in calibration quality across various models and datasets with varying intensities of label shift. **The results highlight the potential of LaSCal for building more reliable AI systems that work effectively in real-world settings where access to labeled target data is limited.**", "affiliation": "ESAT-PSI, KU Leuven", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Unsupervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "TALJtWX7w4/podcast.wav"}
