This is largely due to their limited and often unexpressive search spaces, which restrict the range of possible architectures that can be explored.  The inherent limitations of these spaces hinder the exploration of fundamentally different architectural paradigms and limit the potential of NAS to drive transformative progress in the field.\n\nTo address these challenges, the paper introduces \"einspace,\" a highly expressive search space based on a probabilistic context-free grammar.  Einspace is designed to support a wide range of architectures with various complexities, including many state-of-the-art designs. Experiments demonstrate that Einspace consistently finds competitive architectures and achieves significant improvements when initialized with strong baselines. The use of simple search algorithms highlights the expressivity of the space and suggests that further advancements are possible using more sophisticated techniques.  This work represents a key step towards a more transformative NAS paradigm that emphasizes search space expressivity and strategic initialization.", "affiliation": "School of Engineering", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "qf1ncViBr5/podcast.wav"}
