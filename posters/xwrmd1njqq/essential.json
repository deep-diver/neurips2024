Existing methods like Sliced Wasserstein (SW) and Generalized Sliced Wasserstein (GSW) fall short in handling this complexity, limiting their use.  These methods efficiently compare distributions by projecting them onto one dimension, but they only work on homogeneous domains, which means all aspects of the data have to be similar. This limits their applicability to diverse data types.\nThis paper introduces a new method called **Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein (H2SW)**, designed to tackle the problem. It uses a novel slicing method that deals with heterogeneous data by separating and then combining information from different data types.  The authors extensively test H2SW on several applications like comparing 3D meshes, showing better performance than existing methods.  They also provide detailed theoretical analysis of the method, proving that it is a valid metric and is computationally efficient.", "affiliation": "University of Texas at Austin", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "XwrMd1njqq/podcast.wav"}
