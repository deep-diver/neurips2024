The GRT shows a linear projection, while HHRT demonstrates a hierarchical approach.  First, partial generalized Radon transforms (PGRT) with different defining functions are applied to each marginal argument. Then, a partial Radon transform (PRT) is applied to the joint transformed arguments to integrate information across marginals. This highlights the key difference between GRT's linear projection and HHRT's more expressive, hierarchical approach, which is better suited for handling heterogeneous joint distributions.", "section": "3 Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein Distance"}, {"figure_path": "XwrMd1njqq/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Visualization of deformation from the sphere mesh to the Armadillo mesh with L = 10.", "description": "This figure visualizes the process of deforming a sphere mesh into an Armadillo mesh using three different Wasserstein distance methods: SW, GSW, and H2SW.
