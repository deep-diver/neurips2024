These methods struggle with the complexity of humanoid control, especially for dexterous manipulation involving diverse objects and trajectories.  Additionally, obtaining and utilizing paired full-body motion and object trajectory data for training is challenging. \n\nOmnigrasp tackles these issues using **reinforcement learning** and a novel **universal and dexterous humanoid motion representation**.  This representation improves sample efficiency and allows the learning of grasping policies for a large number of objects without requiring paired full-body motion and object trajectory datasets. The learned controller demonstrates high success rates in grasping and following complex trajectories, showcasing its scalability and generalization capabilities. The method's simplicity in reward and state design along with excellent performance makes it a substantial advance in the field.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "Glt37xoU7e/podcast.wav"}
