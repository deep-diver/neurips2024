The first stage (a) focuses on creating a universal and dexterous humanoid motion representation using a technique called distillation. This representation is then used in the second stage (b) to train a policy that enables the humanoid to grasp and follow trajectories using pre-grasp guidance.  The figure shows the flow of information and the different components involved in each stage, including the use of a pretrained motion imitator and a physics simulator.", "section": "4 Omnigrasp: Grasping Diverse Objects and Follow Object Trajectories"}, {"figure_path": "Glt37xoU7e/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Omnigrasp is trained in two stages.

The first stage (a) focuses on learning a universal and dexterous humanoid motion representation using a technique called distillation. This representation serves as the foundation for the grasping policy.  The second stage (b) trains a grasping policy that leverages the pre-trained motion representation. This stage uses a pre-grasp guided approach, meaning the policy is trained to initially position its hand for a successful grasp before attempting to lift the object.", "section": "4 Omnigrasp: Grasping Diverse Objects and Follow Object Trajectories"}, {"figure_path": "Glt37xoU7e/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Qualitative results.

For each dataset, several examples are shown of the simulated humanoid grasping and manipulating objects, following trajectories indicated by green dots (reference trajectory).
