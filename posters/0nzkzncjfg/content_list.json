Firstly, data distributions can vary across users (often called statistical heterogeneity [27, 76]), which reduces the effectiveness of a single, shared model for all users. Secondly, the data may be sensitive and mutually beneficial collaboration may compromise user privacy [31, 71]. An important practical problem where user data distributions are diverse, and user-privacy is paramount is next-word prediction for the keyboard input on user devices. Users often have diverse vocabulary, writing styles, and topics that leads to varied data distributions [32, 36, 65]. Naturally, frequency estimation is also one of the most basic statistical tasks with numerous other applications [14, 47].

In this problem, each user has very few $(O(d))$ samples from an unknown, user-specific distribution over a large, finite domain of size $d$ . The users interact with a server that needs to provide the user with a personalized estimate of their distribution. We focus on error measured in KL divergence that is common in language modeling [3, 38], and is equivalent to minimizing the negative log-likelihood of samples from the user distribution. For more general loss minimization problems, numerous personalized federated learning (PFL) algorithms [67, 76], tackle statistical heterogeneity by first learning a single global model across all users (for e.g., FedAvg [57]), and then finetuning (FT) the global model locally for each user (FedAvg+FT [18, 20]), thus balancing collaboration and personalization. The downside of this approach is that it is agnostic to the structure of the user population which is highly heterogeneous, but often consists of a number of concentrated subpopulations of similar users.

Relying on the optimal competitive estimation rates for local Good-Turing estimators, we propose to estimate global cluster centers by averaging user-level Good-Turing estimates for the current users in the cluster. Furthermore, since the performance of clustering is significantly affected by the initialization [5] of cluster centers, we also propose a data-dependent initialization approach, also specific to estimation in KL. We improve the practicality of our algorithm by separately handling data-poor users in cases where users vary significantly in their local data sizes (size-heteogeneity).

This definition is necessary due to the final personalization step which happens locally on user device and thus does not present a privacy risk. Specifically, we make each iteration of our clustering algorithm provably private by relying on adaptive clipping, secure aggregation, and common noise addition mechanisms [23].

Cummings et al. [21] propose an algorithm to estimate the private heterogeneous mean of user data from different Bernoulli distributions, but their approach does not directly transfer to our setting due to the highdimensional nature of our user means and the relatively poor sensitivity of Alg. 3 to errors in the estimation of cluster centers at each iteration. Thus we consider a two-stage approach, split across data-rich and data-poor users. In the first stage we privately cluster users with sufficiently large datasets applying Alg. 3, and treating them as size-homogeneous data-rich users. Once cluster centers are learned privately, using Alg. 1, each data-poor user assigns itself to the closest center in KL divergence. Finally for each cluster, we apply Algorithm 2 from Cummings et al. [21] that re-centers each cluster privately, based on the newly added users.

Nevertheless, we find that existing algorithms in the federated learning literature when applied to our problem setting perform suboptimally, and require problem specific interventions we introduce, like Algorithms 3, 5, and Good-Turing based estimators. Our current work also does not handle a federated version of the private initialization algorithm we propose. We suggest handling the initialization at the central node that maintains a small dataset of clients. This is a known limitation for sampling from the exponential mechanism in a federated setting. At the same time we would like to point out, that all our other algorithms, including private ones can be implemented in the federated setting.

[21] also study the problem of private heterogeneous mean estimation but do not consider the clustered setting, or the subtleties of estimatation in KL divergence. More recent works (e.g., [42, 43]) propose personalization algorithms that are user-level private, but are mainly tailored for settings where the different models for each user share representations or lie in a hidden low rank subspace. In contrast, we explore another latent structure more suited for histogram estimation, i.e., one where histograms need only be concentrated around the vertices of a low-dimensional polytope. Other works [10, 41, 75] propose gradient-based algorithms for private multi-task learning where they learn different models for each user (task), regularized using inter-task prior relationship matrices.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
