{"importance": "This paper is important because it significantly improves visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) by leveraging large foundation models.  **This addresses a critical challenge in VI-ReID, the lack of color information in infrared images.** The proposed framework, TVI-LFM, offers a novel approach to enhance infrared representations and improve retrieval accuracy, paving the way for more robust and efficient multi-modal retrieval systems.  This work also introduces three new expanded VI-ReID datasets for future research.", "summary": "Large foundation models empower visible-infrared person re-identification by enriching infrared image representations with automatically generated textual descriptions, significantly improving cross-modal retrieval accuracy.", "takeaways": ["A novel Text-enhanced VI-ReID framework (TVI-LFM) leverages large foundation models to improve cross-modal retrieval by enriching infrared image representations with automatically generated text descriptions.", "TVI-LFM introduces an incremental fine-tuning strategy to align generated text with original images and learn complementary information from infrared modality.", "The Modality Ensemble Retrieval strategy improves retrieval performance by combining the strengths of infrared, visible, and text-based query modalities."], "tldr": "Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) faces the challenge of significant modality differences due to the absence of color information in infrared images. Existing methods often struggle to effectively bridge this gap, resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance.  This limitation hinders the development of robust and reliable VI-ReID systems for real-world applications.\n\nTo address this issue, the researchers propose a novel Text-enhanced VI-ReID framework driven by Large Foundation Models (TVI-LFM).  **TVI-LFM uses large language and vision-language models to automatically generate textual descriptions for infrared images, effectively enriching their representations**. The framework incorporates an incremental fine-tuning strategy to align these generated texts with the original images and a modality ensemble retrieval strategy to leverage the complementary strengths of various modalities. The results demonstrate that TVI-LFM significantly improves VI-ReID performance on three expanded datasets, showcasing its effectiveness and robustness.", "affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center for Multimedia Software,School of Computer Science,Wuhan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Cross-Modal Retrieval"}, "podcast_path": "qQlmONeI5k/podcast.wav"}
