Particularly, [15] demonstrated a substantial degradation in LLMs\u2019 performance when crucial information is positioned amidst a lengthy context, a phenomenon they refer to as \u201clost-in-the-middle\". One explanation is about the use of rotary positional embedding (RoPE) [16], a prevalent positional encoding technique used in open-source LLMs. As a relative position embedding, RoPE incorporates a long-term decay property, predisposing the model to prioritize current/nearby tokens while paying less attention to further ones. [17] identified a surprising trend attributed to the Softmax operation where attention scores are disproportionately allocated into initial tokens, irrespective of their relevance to the language modeling task. Despite the presence of considerable redundancy in long-context inputs [18], crucial information may be located across different positions. The inclination of LLMs to overlook the middle section presents a challenge for their applications, particularly in the context of long-context reasoning. Several approaches successfully extend pre-trained LLMs with context up to extreme token length, either through sparse selection of crucial tokens during generation [17, 18, 19] or by modifying positional encoding [20, 21].

Introducing multi-scale operations into LLMs intuitively can help compensate for crucial information located in the middle, which might be easily overlooked by full attention operation. Unlike modifying the attention module to form multi-scale attention, we choose to re-scale the indices of positional encoding. This decision is grounded not only in its effectiveness in easily adjusting the scale of the context window by simply changing the position indices [20] but also in the potential of down-scaling the position indices to relieve the long-term decay property introduced by RoPE. However, this approach was initially introduced to extend context windows, and its performance regarding the \u201clostin-the-middle\u201d problem remains uncertain for several reasons: (i) Indice re-scaling forces position embeddings of original context window to reside in a narrower region, leading to performance degradation in the original context window as shown in [20].

Additionally, we observe that different attention heads exhibit varying sensitivity to the position shift of the relevant document. Some attention heads are \u201cposition-aware\u201d, consistently capturing relevant information even with position shifts, while others may occasionally capture position changes, and some heads are completely insensitive to position changes.

In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.   \n\u2022 The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.   \n\u2022 The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.   \n\u2022 If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.   \n\u2022 While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren\u2019t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
