These methods also often compromise multi-view information to manage costs.  Existing feed-forward Gaussian reconstruction models typically adopt powerful yet computationally intensive architectures to generate long sequences of Gaussians for intricate 3D modeling, compromising the integrity of multi-view information propagation to manage computational costs.\nThe researchers introduce MVGamba, a lightweight Gaussian reconstruction model featuring a multi-view Gaussian reconstructor based on the RNN-like State Space Model (SSM). This approach efficiently maintains multi-view information integrity and enables cross-view self-refinement.  MVGamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across various 3D generation tasks (image-to-3D, text-to-3D, and sparse-view reconstruction), exhibiting approximately 10 times smaller model size compared to baselines.", "affiliation": "Nanyang Technological University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "AprsVxrwXT/podcast.wav"}
