This necessitates the development of robust automated methods for handling irregular and complex data, especially considering the current explosion of ordinary 3D data from different sources. This is a challenge because traditional methods often rely on laborious manual processes and are restricted to simple topologies. \nThe paper introduces the Flatten Anything Model (FAM), an unsupervised neural network architecture for global free-boundary surface parameterization. Unlike traditional methods, FAM operates directly on discrete surface points, eliminating the need for pre-processing and mesh quality constraints. It ingeniously uses a bi-directional cycle mapping framework, incorporating sub-networks for surface cutting, UV deforming, unwrapping, and wrapping to mimic the physical parameterization process.  FAM demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods across various datasets, proving its universality and efficiency in handling complex topologies.  This fully automated approach significantly improves the efficiency and robustness of surface parameterization.", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "eNeqGc9AgR/podcast.wav"}
