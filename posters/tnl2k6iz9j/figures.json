The price of the two rides differs by nearly double, yet the booking fee remains at $1.27 for both, suggesting that a fixed booking fee mechanism might be employed in February. However, over a longer period of time, Uber may switch to a dynamic pricing strategy.", "description": "This figure shows two Uber ride receipts with different total prices but the same booking fee.  It illustrates that while Uber uses a fixed booking fee in a short time period, it may dynamically adjust prices over a longer period to maximize revenue and adapt to demand.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "Tnl2K6Iz9j/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: 95% confidence region of regret of Algorithm 1 over 10 trajectories: \u03c3s = 1 (left) and \u03c3s = 0 (right).", "description": "This figure displays the 95% confidence intervals for the regret of Algorithm 1 across 10 separate simulation runs.

Four scenarios are presented, each with a different level of supply randomness (\u03c3s): 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2.  The plots illustrate the impact of varying supply randomness on the algorithm's performance, showing how regret changes over time (rounds).

When the supply randomness is low (\u03c3s \u2264 O(1/\u221aT)), the regret scales as O(\u221aT). However, when the supply randomness is high (\u03c3s \u2265 \u03a9(1/\u221aT)), the regret decreases significantly to O(1).

The blue dots represent the raw data, and the red line shows the results of locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS). The plot shows a clear phase transition around \u03c3s \u2248 0.1, where the regret decreases significantly as supply randomness increases. This is consistent with the theoretical findings of the paper, indicating that supply randomness can significantly help with the learning of demand information.", "section": "Numerical Study"}]
