It shows the impact of removing key components of the model, such as the Seg-Mix augmentation, the initialization method, and the use of descriptive classes. The D&C-DS and D&C-DINO metrics measure multi-subject fidelity, showing the performance drop when each component is removed.  The results highlight the importance of each component for achieving high multi-subject fidelity.", "section": "5.3 Ablation studies"}, {"figure_path": "tEEpVPDaRf/tables/tables_22_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Quantitative results on multi-subject fidelity and text fidelity. \u2020 denotes the text fidelity score considering the permutation of the subjects in the prompt to avoid position bias.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of MuDI against several baseline methods across two key aspects: multi-subject fidelity and text fidelity. Multi-subject fidelity is assessed using two metrics: D&C-DS and D&C-DINO. Text fidelity is evaluated using ImageReward and CLIPs.  Higher scores indicate better performance. The \u2020 symbol indicates that text fidelity scores were adjusted to avoid bias from the order of subjects in prompts.", "section": "5.2 Main results"}]
