Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) models aim to solve this by only activating a subset of expert networks for each input. However, SMoE suffers from low expert activation, meaning many experts remain unused, limiting the model's potential. This leads to suboptimal performance and hinders scalability. \nTo overcome this, the researchers propose Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts (MH-MoE). MH-MoE splits each input token into sub-tokens, assigning them to different expert networks in parallel. This approach ensures that most experts get activated, leading to denser expert utilization.  Extensive experiments show that MH-MoE significantly improves expert activation, boosting performance and scalability compared to previous SMoE methods across various tasks and model sizes. **MH-MoE demonstrates higher expert activation and better scalability, resulting in improved performance across diverse downstream tasks.**  **Its simple design makes it easy to integrate into existing frameworks, furthering its potential impact on large model development.**", "affiliation": "Microsoft Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "dyZ8GJZjtX/podcast.wav"}
