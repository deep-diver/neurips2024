We vary the number of basis functions from 1 to 30 and average the residuals over all $n=93$ Berkeley growth rate functions. Given a function $f\\in\\mathbb{L}^{2}$ , its projection onto the basis is $\\begin{array}{r}{\\hat{f}=\\sum_{j=1}^{B}\\hat{a}_{j}\\phi_{j}}\\end{array}$ , where $\\begin{array}{r}{\\hat{a}_{j}\\,=\\,\\int_{0}^{1}f(t)\\phi_{j}(t)d t}\\end{array}$ , $j=1,\\dots,B,B$ is the number of basis functions used in the projection, and $\\phi_{j}$ , $j=1,\\dots,B$ are the basis functions.

Overall, we expect the average residual from (ii) to be lower than the average residual from (i). However, an interesting aspect of this experiment is to understand how much more expressive the basis is when an additional rotation via the norm-preserving action is allowed, especially when very few basis elements are used in the projection. The results are presented in Figure 6. The average residuals, for $B=1,\\ldots,30$ , based on (i) and (ii) are shown in blue and red. As expected, (ii) yields lower average residuals, with a very large gap for $B=1,\\ldots,10$ . The inclusion of the norm-preserving action becomes less valuable when a large number of basis elements is used. This is also expected since a data-driven rotation of the coordinate system becomes less crucial when more and more coordinates, defined with respect to the basis, are included. This shows that, when a small number of basis elements is used in the specification of $\\mu$ in our model, the norm-preserving action allows for more flexible and efficient modeling, by rotating the coordinate system for $\\mu$ to the observed data.
