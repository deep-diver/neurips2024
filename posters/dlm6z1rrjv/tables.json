Each cell contains the utilities for Player 1 (row player) and Player 2 (column player). The example highlights a case where a less-informed player can become more informed faster than a better-informed player, negating the initial information advantage.", "section": "4 Interactions between two partially-informed players"}, {"figure_path": "Dlm6Z1RrjV/tables/tables_8_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Example game matrices G = {G1, G2} revealing more information to P2 compared to P1.
