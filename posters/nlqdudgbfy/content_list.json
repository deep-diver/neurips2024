However, even for the simplest rotation prediction method, there is a lack of rigorous understanding of why, when, and how E-SSL learns useful features for downstream tasks. To bridge this gap between practice and theory, we establish an information-theoretic perspective to understand the generalization ability of E-SSL. In particular, we identify a critical explaining-away effect in E-SSL that creates a synergy between the equivariant and classification tasks. This synergy effect encourages models to extract class-relevant features to improve its equivariant prediction, which, in turn, beneftis downstream tasks requiring semantic features. Based on this perspective, we theoretically analyze the influence of data transformations and reveal several principles for practical designs of E-SSL. Our theory not only aligns well with existing E-SSL methods but also sheds light on new directions by exploring the beneftis of model equivariance.

One effective approach to corrupt these style features (to some extent) through aggressive data augmentation, e.g., color jitter, cropping, and blurring commonly adopted in contrastive learning, without corrupting class features a lot. Indeed, Chen et al. [13] show that the choice of data augmentations plays a vital rule in the success of contrastive learning, and Tian et al. [62] point out its goal is to prune class-irrelevant features. Here, we generalize this principle to E-SSL as well through our explaining-away framework. As shown in Table 1, the aggressive data augmentations from SimCLR also bring much better performance for E-SSL methods, bringing RotNet $(82.26\\%)$ close to SimCLR $(89.49\\%)$ . It demonstrates that instead of merging with contrastive learning as in all recent E-SSL works [67, 17, 18, 25, 54, 34], learning from equivariance alone can potentially achieve competitive performance.

For example, four-fold rotation is a 4-way classification task while CIFAR100 has 100 classes. When the neural networks are expressive enough such that it clusters samples with the same augmentation to (almost) the same representation (known as neural collapse [53]), the class features also degrade or vanish, which hinders downstream classification.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
