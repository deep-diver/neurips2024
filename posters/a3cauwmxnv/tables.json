The running times are compared for three different graph sizes (number of nodes): 50, 200, and 1000.  It demonstrates the scalability of the proposed Fair GLASSO algorithm, showing that despite increased graph size, the computation time remains relatively manageable compared to the baseline graphical lasso method.", "section": "4.2 Performance as Graph Size Increases"}, {"figure_path": "a3cauWMXNV/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Bias and error for estimating four real-world networks.
