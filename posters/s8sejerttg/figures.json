The CKG network fuses inconsistent detections from the cloud detector and the CLIP detector.  It uses cross-attention modules to compute adaptive weights for each detection based on its features and the class prototypes from both detectors. These weights are then used to generate refined probabilities that align with the consistent detections, thus improving the overall accuracy of the target detector. The use of cross-attention allows the network to learn relationships between the features of the inconsistent detections and the class prototypes of both detectors effectively handling conflicting information.", "section": "3.3 Knowledge Distillation"}, {"figure_path": "S8SEjerTTg/figures/figures_25_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Overview of the proposed method COIN.
