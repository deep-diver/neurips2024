For each network, it lists the number of nodes (n), the number of edges (m), whether the network is directed or undirected, and the average degree of the nodes.  These characteristics provide context for understanding the scale and structure of the datasets used in evaluating the influence maximization algorithm.", "section": "6.1 Experimental setup"}]
