Our full model performs better than baselines and variants in terms of trajectory accuracy, visual quality, and alignment with input text.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of the proposed ChatCam model against several baseline methods (SA3D and LERF) for camera trajectory generation based on text descriptions.  It evaluates the performance across several metrics: Translation MSE (lower is better), Rotation MSE (lower is better), Visual Quality (higher is better, as rated by human judges), and Alignment (higher is better, also assessed by human judges). Different LLM agents (LLaMA-2, GPT-3.5, GPT-4) and variations of ChatCam (with and without anchor determination) are included in the comparison to show the impact of each component of the model. The results indicate that the complete ChatCam system using GPT-4 achieves superior performance in all aspects.", "section": "4.2 Results"}]
