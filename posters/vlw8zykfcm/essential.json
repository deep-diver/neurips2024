Neural operators offer a data-driven alternative, learning the relationship between inputs and outputs without explicit equations. However, existing neural operators often suffer from high computational costs, particularly when dealing with large datasets.  This limitation hinders their applicability to complex, real-world scenarios.  \nThis paper introduces the Latent Neural Operator (LNO) to overcome these challenges.  LNO leverages a latent space to reduce computational complexity while maintaining accuracy.  It introduces a novel Physics-Cross-Attention (PhCA) module for efficient data transformation between the original space and the latent space, allowing for accurate predictions and interpolation/extrapolation. The experimental results demonstrate that LNO significantly improves computational efficiency (faster training and reduced memory usage) and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on several benchmark problems. The method also shows promise for solving inverse PDE problems.", "affiliation": "Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "VLw8ZyKfcm/podcast.wav"}
