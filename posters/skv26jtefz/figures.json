The triangle inequality shows that ||H\u2081 \u2013 P||tv \u2264 ||H\u2081 \u2013 H\u1d62*||tv + ||H\u1d62* \u2013 P||tv.  The semi-distance w\u1d62*(H\u1d62) is defined as |H\u1d62(S\u1d62,\u2c7c) - P(S\u1d62,\u2c7c)|, where S\u1d62,\u2c7c is the Scheff\u00e9 set for H\u1d62 and H\u1d62*. The figure demonstrates that w\u1d62*(H\u1d62) is a lower bound for ||H\u1d62 \u2013 P||tv, and W(H\u1d62) (the maximum semi-distance for H\u1d62) is used as a proxy for the quality of H\u1d62 because it is an upper bound for w\u1d62*(H\u1d62).", "section": "3 Overview of our techniques"}, {"figure_path": "Skv26JteFz/figures/figures_13_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1.

It shows that wj(Hi) (the semi-distance) is always a lower bound for ||H\u2081 \u2013 P||tv. The figure highlights the triangle inequality relationship among ||H\u2081 \u2013 P||tv, ||H\u2081 \u2013 Hi*||tv (where Hi* is the closest hypothesis to P), and OPT. It demonstrates that if wi* (Hi) is bounded by OPT, then H\u2081 is close to P. The main point is that even without knowing i* or OPT, the minimum distance estimate algorithm uses W(Hi) as a proxy for the quality of Hi and successfully bounds ||\u0124 \u2013 P||tv (where \u0124 is the output hypothesis) by 3OPT.", "section": "3 Overview of our techniques"}]
