It incorporates three key innovations:  biased loss estimators (implicit exploration), an adjusted skipping threshold, and a novel control of distribution drift under highly varying delays. The algorithm maintains a set of skipped rounds, a cumulative count of active outstanding observations, and a vector of cumulative observed loss estimates.  At each round, it samples an arm based on an FTRL distribution, updates loss estimates, counts outstanding observations, and applies a skipping threshold to manage excessive delays.  The skipping threshold and loss estimates are dynamically adjusted based on the running count of outstanding observations.", "section": "3 Algorithm"}]
