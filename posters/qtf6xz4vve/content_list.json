The model first learns the center of mass of the modes and then progressively resolve all modes through a cascade of phase transitions. We first describe this process analytically in a controlled setup that allows us to study analytically the training dynamics.

By using datasets of increasing dimension, we show that learning indeed leads to sharp phase transitions in the high-dimensional limit. Moreover, we propose and test a mean-field finite-size scaling hypothesis.

Although energy-based models [4] and variational approaches [5] have been in use for decades, the emergence of generative adversarial networks [6], followed by diffusion models [7], has significantly improved the quality of outputs. Generative models are designed to learn the empirical distribution of datasets in a high-dimensional space, where the dataset is represented as a Dirac-delta pointwise distribution. While different types of difficulties are encounter when training these models, there is a general lack of understanding of how the learning mechanism is driven by the considered dataset. This article explores the dynamics of learning in neural networks, focusing on pattern formation. Understanding how this process shapes the learned probability distribution is complex. Previous studies [8, 9] on the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) [10] showed that the singular vectors of the weight matrix initially evolve to align with the principal directions of the dataset, with similar results in a 3-layer Deep Boltzmann Machine [11]. Additionally, an analysis using data from the 1D Ising model explained weight formation in an RBM with a single hidden node as a reaction-diffusion process [12]. The main contribution of this work is to demonstrate that the RBM undergoes a series of second-order phase transitions during learning, each corresponding to the acquisition of new data features. This is shown theoretically with a simplified model and on correlated patterns; and confirmed numerically with real datasets, revealing a progressive segmentation of the learned probability distribution into distinct parts and exhibiting second order phase transitions.

Early work on deep linear neural networks demonstrated that even simple models exhibit complex behaviors during training, such as exponential growth in model parameters [13, 14]. Using singular value decomposition (SVD) of the weight matrix, researchers revealed a hierarchical learning structure with rapid transitions to lower error solutions. Linear regression dynamics later showed a connection between the SVD of the dataset and the double-descent phenomenon [15]. Similar dynamics were found in Gaussian-Gaussian RBMs [9], where learning mechanisms led to rapid transitions for the modes of the model\u2019s weight matrix. In this context, the variance of the overall distribution is adjusted to that of the principal direction of the dataset, while the singular vectors of the weight matrix are aligned to that of the dataset. Unlike linear models, non-linear neural-networks, supervised or unsupervised ones, can not exhibit partition of the input\u2019s space. Yet, linear model in general can not provide a multimodal partition of the input space, should it be in supervised or unsupervised context, at difference with non-linear ones. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "It was then shown that the most common binary-binary RBMs exhibit very similar patterns at the beginning of learning, transitioning from a paramagnetic to a condensation phase in which the learned distribution splits into a multimodal distribution whose modes are linked to the SVD of the weight matrix [8]. The description of this process motivated the use of RBMs to perform unsupervised hierarchical clustering of data [16, 17]. The succession of phase transitions had been previously observed in the process of training a Gaussian mixture [18, 19, 20], and in the analysis of teacher-student models using statistical mechanics [21, 22]. The latter cases are easier to understand analytically due to the simplicity of the Gaussian mixture. Nevertheless, the learned features are somewhat simpler, as they are mainly represented by the means and variances of the individual clusters. Recently, sequences of phase transitions have been used to explain the mechanism with which diffusion model are hierarchically shaping the mode of the reverse diffusion process [23, 24, 25] and due to a spontaneous broken symmetry [26] after a linear phase converging toward a central fixed-point. The common observation is that the learning of a distribution is, in many cases, obtained by a succession of creation of modes performed through a second order process where the variance in one direction first grow before splitting into two parts, and then the mechanism is repeated. This procedure in particular demonstrate a hierarchical splitting, where the system refined at finer and finer scale of features as it adjust its parameters on a given dataset.

On Fig. 1, right panel, we illustrate the exponential growth as described by the theory, toward the two directions.

In fact, we often found that the patterns are not perfectly aligned because we are not forcing the weights to be binary. This analysis can naturally extend to more than two patterns, typically resulting in a cascade of phase transitions. In this process, the RBM progressively learns the data features, starting from a coarse-grained version (just the center of mass) and gradually refining until all patterns are learned. The analysis done on the BG-RBM can of course be repeated on the BB-RBM (as is done for the case with one mode in the SI B). The main difference at that level between the two models is that in order to have a retrieval phase, the BB-RBM needs to encode the patterns on an extensive number of hidden nodes (proportional to $N_{\\mathrm{v}}$ ), while the BG-RBM needs only as many patterns as hidden nodes.

In Fig. 3\u2013F we show each of these mode susceptibilities $\\chi_{m_{\\alpha}}$ as a function of their corresponding singular value.

Exceeding second-order phase transitions has a very strong impact on the overall quality of the training, in particular on the quality of the log-likelihood gradient estimated by MCMC dynamics.

We used two examples: one with two symmetric clusters and another with four correlated clusters. Our results show that the learning dynamics identify modes by exponential growth in the directions of the clusters dominated by the variances of these clusters. The theory predicts the timing of the first phase transitions and agrees well with [8]. Numerically, we have confirmed the existence of a cascade of phase transitions associated with the growing modes $w_{\\alpha}$ and accompanied by divergent susceptibility. Finite-size scaling suggests that these transitions are critical and fall into the class of mean-field universality. This set of phase transitions likely goes beyond RBMs and offers insights into learning mechanisms, particularly for generative models. These transitions have significant implications for both training and understanding the learned features. During training, each transition is associated with a divergent MCMC relaxation time, which requires careful handling to properly train the model. In addition, the hysteresis phenomenon ensures that the learning trajectory involves second-order phase transitions, which are beneficial for tracking the emergence of modes in the learned distribution. However, changing parameters (such as the local bias) could lead to first-order transitions that are detrimental to sampling and could explain the ineffectiveness of parallel tempering in the presence of temperature changes.

The Hamiltonian follows the same expression as the BB-RBM, Eq. 1. The hidden nodes are Gaussian random variables centred in zero with variance $\\sigma_{h}^{2}$ . In our analysis where we use only one or few hidden nodes, it is important that the variance scales as the inverse of the system\u2019s size $\\sigma_{h}^{2}=1/N_{\\mathrm{v}}$ in order for the Hamiltonian of the system to be an extensive property (proportional to $N_{\\mathrm{v}}$ ).

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
