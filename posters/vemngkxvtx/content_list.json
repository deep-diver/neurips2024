In transferring to downstream tasks with limited data resources, the conventional full fine-tuning on VLMs often forgets the general knowledge learned in pre-training and falls into overfitting.

To better transfer VLMs to downstream tasks especially with limited target domain data, a lot of research on efficient transfer learning has been done, which mainly exists in two types, prompt tuning and adapter tuning. Advanced than manual prompt that demands domain expertise to develop suitable format, prompt tuning methods design learnable prompts to adapt VLMs on downstream data. As a pioneer work, CoOp [9] for the first time composed prompts by concatenating text category embedding and learnable context vectors. The learnable prompts can be configured in text input [9, 10], image input [11] or jointly both [12, 13]. A line of work focuses on injecting semantic priors, such as category-related external knowledge [14, 15], category embedding distribution [16] and the diversity of visual concepts [17, 18], in prompt tuning. In another branch, adapter tuning methods insert a learnable lightweight adapter module into the frozen pre-trained VLMs and show excellent performance. The adapter architecture and insertion manner allow for flexible modifications. There are two main paradigms: residual blending and key-value cache based. By residual blending, CLIP-Adapter [19] appended learnable bottleneck layer to frozen encoder to tune embeddings. TaskRes [20] added a set of prior-independent parameters to frozen text category embeddings to obtain an image classifier. GraphAdapter [27] proposed to learn downstream knowledge with inter-class relationship of image and text samples. Based on the key-value cache model, Tip-Adapter [21] constructed an adapter with training images and label encodings as keyvalue to recognize query images. APE [22] refined the cache model by visual discrimination priors. CaFo [23] cascaded diverse external knowledge from DINO [28], DALL-E [29], and GPT-3 [30] to assist recognition. However, although existing methods have attained remarkable achievements in VLMs transfer, they adjust the semantic alignment [31\u201333] of image and text latent manifolds toward downstream tasks merely on observed samples, e.g., data sets and external knowledge bases, and lack insight into underlying manifold structure, which may cause unguaranteed generalization beyond the data samples.

[36] used discrete Morse theory and persistent homology to learn the structural representation of images for fine-scale structure segmentation. In graph machine learning, [39] integrated vertex- and edge-level topological features into message-passing graph neural networks to boost their expressive power. In point cloud analysis, [44] developed a learnable flitration on point clouds to obtain adaptive topological features for given tasks. Besides, [45] preserved the topological structures of input space into latent space of autoencoders by aligning topologically relevant distances. [46] applied representation topology divergence [47] in dimensionality reduction to force closeness on topological structures.

Two homeomorphic spaces share the exact same topological properties, i.e., from the topological point of view, the two are completely consistent. Another less rigid relation is homotopy equivalent [24, 26].

Besides, image and text data are both relevant and complementary concrete expressions of the real world. The latent manifolds in which they reside can be seen as deformation retracts of the general world knowledge space. Thus, it is rational to consider that the image latent manifold and text latent manifold are homotogy equivalent.
