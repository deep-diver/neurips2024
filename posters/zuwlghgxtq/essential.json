{"importance": "This paper is **crucial** for researchers working on heavy-tailed sampling because it **identifies a fundamental limitation** of Gaussian-based samplers and **introduces a novel high-accuracy approach** using stable oracles. This **opens new avenues** for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of Bayesian statistics, machine learning, and other fields dealing with heavy-tailed data. The **separation result** is a significant contribution to the theoretical understanding of sampling algorithms.", "summary": "Stable oracles outperform Gaussian oracles in high-accuracy heavy-tailed sampling, overcoming limitations of Gaussian-based proximal samplers.", "takeaways": ["Gaussian-based proximal samplers have a fundamental barrier in achieving high accuracy for heavy-tailed distributions.", "Stable-oracle based proximal samplers overcome this barrier, offering high-accuracy guarantees.", "Theoretical lower and upper bounds are provided for both Gaussian and stable oracle-based samplers."], "tldr": "Sampling from heavy-tailed distributions is a challenge for gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms due to diminishing gradients.  Existing approaches often provide only low-accuracy guarantees, requiring many iterations for sufficient accuracy.  This paper focuses on proximal samplers, which are commonly used algorithms. \nThe paper presents a separation result between Gaussian and stable oracles used in proximal samplers for heavy-tailed distributions.  It proves that Gaussian-based proximal samplers inherently have low-accuracy guarantees for certain heavy-tailed targets. In contrast, stable-oracle based proximal samplers offer high-accuracy guarantees, demonstrating a significant improvement in sampling efficiency.  The authors also establish lower bounds, demonstrating that these upper bounds cannot be significantly improved.", "affiliation": "Georgia Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "zuwLGhgxtQ/podcast.wav"}
