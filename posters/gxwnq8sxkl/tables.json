It highlights the key theoretical results and their implications for different learning settings (update-and-deploy and blind-prediction) under both discrete and continuous data streams. The contributions include establishing the learnability of concept classes in the update-and-deploy setting using a uniform sampling algorithm, demonstrating the non-learnability of nontrivial concept classes in the blind-prediction setting, characterizing learnability of pattern classes using adaptive algorithms, and developing a theory of pattern classes under discrete data streams for the blind-prediction setting.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
