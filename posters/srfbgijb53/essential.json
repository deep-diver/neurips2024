{"importance": "This paper is important because it addresses a critical challenge in the field of large language models (LLMs): enhancing safety without sacrificing usability.  Existing methods often prioritize safety to the detriment of usability, rendering them less effective in real-world applications.  **MoGU offers a novel solution by dynamically balancing the contributions of a usable and a safe LLM variant, leading to improved safety and enhanced usability.** This work provides valuable insights and a practical framework for LLM developers and researchers seeking to build safer and more practical LLMs.", "summary": "MoGU: A framework dynamically balances safety and usability in LLMs by routing benign and malicious instructions to different LLM variants, leading to safer, more useful responses.", "takeaways": ["The MoGU framework effectively balances safety and usability in LLMs by dynamically routing instructions to different LLM variants.", "MoGU outperforms existing defense mechanisms in maintaining safety while preserving usability across various LLM models.", "The dynamic routing mechanism in MoGU effectively balances the contribution of each LLM variant by assigning weights, ensuring both safety and usability."], "tldr": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed but raise safety concerns, especially when dealing with malicious instructions.  Existing solutions prioritize safety, reducing usability. This often leads to a rejection-oriented approach, limiting the practical applicability of LLMs. \n\nThe MoGU framework tackles this challenge. It transforms the base LLM into two variants: a highly usable LLM and a very safe LLM.  A dynamic routing mechanism balances their contributions based on instruction type.  **Malicious prompts trigger the safe LLM, while benign prompts use the usable LLM.** This approach significantly improves both safety and usability across various LLMs, surpassing existing defense mechanisms.", "affiliation": "Harbin Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "SrFbgIjb53/podcast.wav"}
