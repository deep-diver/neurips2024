For each example, it shows the question, the reference answer (from the dataset), the answer generated by the LLaMA-2-13B-chat language model, and two alignment scores (A\u1d62 and \u00c2\u1d62).  The score A\u1d62 indicates whether the generated answer is aligned with the reference answer (1 for aligned, 0 for not aligned).  The score \u00c2\u1d62 is a predicted alignment score generated by the Conformal Alignment model. This table shows how Conformal Alignment selects answers with high alignment scores and abstains from using others. A threshold of 0.388 was used in this instance for selecting  answers deemed trustworthy.", "section": "D.5 Real examples in QA"}]
