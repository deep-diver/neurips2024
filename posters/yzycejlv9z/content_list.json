On the other hand, to control the risk/mFDR, [12] proposes a method that searches for the cutoff over a grid of values, and then takes a union bound to achieve the overall error control, which might be conservative.

We detail our contributions as follows. First, we justify that selecting reliable outputs with FDR control is a practically reasonable criterion for downstream tasks. Second, we formulate the alignment problem as a selective prediction problem that can be tackled with conformal selection, adapting conformal selection to the current setting. Note that while conformal selection is an established method, its current application in job hiring and drug discovery requires numerical outputs and predictions; the task of aligning foundation model outputs, however, does not come with a clear numerical output. To make conformal selection applicable to our purpose, we formulate the alignment status as a numerical indicator that could be inferred with reference information, and then decide how to train a prediction model for the alignment score, which can therefore be used in conjunction with the conformal selection framework. Our third contribution is the implementation of the pipeline. In this regard, we conduct extensive numerical experiments, finding that using a lightweight prediction model such as logistic regression or random forests with popular heuristic (uncalibrated) uncertainty measures is often sufficient for identifying reliable outputs.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
