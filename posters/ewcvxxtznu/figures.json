For a protein target, we can have multiple candidate ligands and rank the preference by certain reward functions, e.g., binding energy. We align the target-aware molecule diffusion model with these preferences by adjusting the conditional likelihoods.", "description": "This figure illustrates the core idea of ALIDIFF, a method to align pretrained target-aware molecule diffusion models with preferred functional properties.  It shows that ALIDIFF shifts the probability distribution of generated molecules to favor those with higher binding affinity (as measured by a reward function).  A protein's binding pocket is shown, along with a high-reward molecule (well-fitting ligand) and a low-reward molecule (poorly-fitting ligand). The likelihood of generating high-reward molecules is increased, while that of low-reward molecules is decreased.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "EWcvxXtzNu/figures/figures_2_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Overview of ALIDIFF.

For each protein target, two candidate ligand molecules are selected, one with high reward (desirable properties like strong binding energy) and one with low reward.

The samples are sorted by their median Vina energy as generated by ALIDIFF.
