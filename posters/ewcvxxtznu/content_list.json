With increasing amount of structural data becoming accessible, generative models have attracted growing attention for structure-based molecule generation. Early research [Skalic et al., 2019] proposes to generate SMILES representations from protein contexts by sequence generative models. Inspired by the progress in 3D and geometric modeling, many works proposed to solve the problem directly in 3D space. For instance, Ragoza et al. [2022] voxelizes molecules within atomic density grids and generates them through a Variational Autoencoder framework. Luo et al. [2021], Peng et al. [2022], Liu et al. [2022], Powers et al. [2023] developed autoregressive models to generate molecules by sequentially placing atoms or chemical groups within the target. Following the autogressive backbone, FLAG[Zhang et al., 2023] and DrugGPS [Zhang and Liu, 2023] take advantage of chemical priors of molecular fragments to generate ligand molecules piece by piece, leading to more realistic substructures. More recently, diffusion models achieved exceptional results in synthesizing high-quality images and texts, which have also been successfully used for ligand molecule generation [Guan et al., 2023, Lin et al., 2022, Schneuing et al., 2023, Huang et al., 2023, Guan et al., 2024]. These models generate molecules by progressively denoising atom types and coordinates while maintaining physical symmetries with SE(3)-equivariant neural networks. While the existing works focus on designing molecules using various deep generative models, they often struggle with generating molecules that exhibit different desirable properties, e.g., strong binding affinity, high synthesizability, and low toxicity. Real-word drug discovery projects almost always seek to optimize or constrain these properties [D Segall, 2012, Bickerton et al., 2012].

For example, ALIDIFF takes binding affinity as our reward function which is computed by AutoDock Vina [Eberhardt et al., 2021] in this work. However, computing binding energy via software is an approximation and sometimes can be very inaccurate. In the future, we plan to explore experiment-measured energy or ensemble different binding affinity calculation software, e.g., GlideScore [Friesner et al., 2004] In addition, in this work, we focus on an offline learning setting where the preference pairs are off-the-shelf. This is because computing binding affinity is computationally expensive. An important future direction to extend the work toward real-world drug discovery scenarios could be incorporating the online setting but with a limited number of query.
