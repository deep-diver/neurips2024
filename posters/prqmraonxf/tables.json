The NE gap is averaged over 10 inference games.  It empirically validates the theoretical result that more pre-training games benefit the final game-playing performance during inference, and that the obtained transformers can indeed learn to approximate NE in an in-context manner.", "section": "5 Empirical Experiments"}]
