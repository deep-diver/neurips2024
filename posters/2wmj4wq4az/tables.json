Seven metrics across three dimensions (Structure, Background Preservation, and CLIP Similarity) are used to evaluate the performance.  The metrics include Distance, PSNR, LPIPS, MSE, SSIM, Whole, and Edited.  Bold values highlight the best performance for each metric.", "section": "6.1 Image Editing"}, {"figure_path": "2wMJ4wq4az/tables/tables_7_2.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Results of dehazing in real-world scenes, evaluation was conducted utilizing Non-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA). Bold indicate the best results.", "description": "This table presents the results of image dehazing experiments using three different methods: NTI (Null-text Inversion), NTI with fixed-point optimization, and fixed-point method without NTI.  The performance is evaluated using two no-reference image quality assessment metrics: BRISQUE and NIQE. Lower scores indicate better image quality. The results show that incorporating fixed-point optimization into NTI significantly improves the quality of dehazed images, while using fixed-point without NTI leads to the worst results.", "section": "6.2 Image Dehazing"}]
