Existing robust GP models often compromise accuracy or computational efficiency. \nThis work introduces Robust Gaussian Processes via Relevance Pursuit (RRP). RRP addresses this by using a sequential selection procedure that identifies and downweights outliers. This is achieved by learning data-point-specific noise levels while maximizing the log marginal likelihood, which surprisingly exhibits strong concavity.  This concavity proves approximation guarantees, ensuring reliability and efficiency.  Experiments show that RRP effectively handles various regression and Bayesian Optimization tasks, especially in challenging scenarios of sparse label corruptions.", "affiliation": "Meta", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Robustness"}, "podcast_path": "5FATPIlWUJ/podcast.wav"}
