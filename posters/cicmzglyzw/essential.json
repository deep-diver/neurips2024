Existing data generation methods face a diversity-validity dilemma, either producing inaccurate or limited datasets. This significantly hinders the development of LLMs capable of robust mathematical problem-solving.\n\nThis research introduces a novel neuro-symbolic framework that overcomes this limitation. By combining the strengths of LLMs for intuitive informalization and math solvers for precise symbolic reasoning, the framework generates diverse and valid mathematical problems.  The method uses projected Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and incorporates a mutation mechanism to control the complexity.  Empirical results demonstrate the high quality of the generated data and show that fine-tuning LLMs on this data significantly outperforms existing models on various mathematical reasoning benchmarks.  This approach offers a robust solution for creating high-quality mathematical training datasets and improving LLMs' mathematical reasoning.", "affiliation": "Nanjing University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "CIcMZGLyZW/podcast.wav"}
