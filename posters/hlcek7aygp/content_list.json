However, there is still a lack of dimensionality reduction methods that can effectively align low-dimensional latent dynamics with movements. To address this gap, we propose Neural Embeddings Rank (NER), a technique that embeds neural dynamics into a 3D latent space and contrasts the embeddings based on movement ranks. NER learns to regress continuous representations of neural dynamics (i.e., embeddings) on continuous movements. We apply NER and six other dimensionality reduction techniques to neurons in the primary motor cortex (M1), dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), and primary somatosensory cortex (S1) as monkeys perform reaching tasks. Only NER aligns latent dynamics with both hand position and direction, visualizable in 3D. NER reveals consistent latent dynamics in M1 and PMd across sixteen sessions over a year. Using a linear regression decoder, NER explains $86\\%$ and $97\\%$ of the variance in velocity and position, respectively. Linear models trained on data from one session successfully decode velocity, position, and direction in held-out test data from different dates and cortical areas ( $64\\%$ , $88\\%$ , and $90\\%$ ). NER also reveals distinct latent dynamics in S1 during consistent movements and in M1 during curved reaching tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/NeuroscienceAI/NER.

However, this static and receptive field-based neural representation fails to explain movement trajectories during simple tasks like reaching. Recent studies have found that the activities of multiple simultaneously recorded neurons, which fire spikes in a time-dependent manner, encode reaching movements [10]. Unlike the one-dimensional dynamics from a single neuron, understanding how movements are represented by these high-dimensional neural dynamics is challenging. In systems neuroscience and brain-machine interfaces, there is significant motivation to reduce these high-dimensional neural dynamics to low-dimensional latent dynamics for at least three reasons: ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "First, visualizing neural dynamics. This involves a trade-off between dimensionality and explained variance. To explain a complex reaching task, at least six dimensions are typically required. For example, in an eight-direction center-out reaching task, [11][9][12] selects fifteen dimensions for the PMd, ten for the M1, and eight for the S1. Therefore, we need to further reduce the dimensionality of these \u201clow-dimensional\u201d latent dynamics. Currently, we still lack a method that can directly explain enough variance within three dimensions. Second, comparing movements-related latent dynamics. After dimensionality reduction, we can visualize the trajectories of latent dynamics over time. For instance, [5] reveals rotational latent dynamics during reaching tasks using principal component analysis (PCA). [25] found that animals performing similar tasks exhibit similar latent dynamics. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "However, these trajectories do not align precisely with the reaching movements: when the hand reaches in eight directions, the trajectories of latent dynamics are neither in eight distinct directions nor well-separated, often appearing entangled. Third, decoding movements using latent dynamics. Decoders trained on individual neural activities are commonly used to predict movements [13]. However, a drawback of using individual neural activities is that when the identities of neurons change during long-term recordings, the decoding performance deteriorates [9]. Additionally, it is infeasible to decode movements from different brain areas or animals. Decoders trained on latent dynamics facilitate long-term and cross-animal decoding [9, 25]. Since latent dynamics do not fully capture neural dynamics, decoding performance is often suboptimal with linear decoders, necessitating the use of nonlinear decoders or deep neural networks [25]. Thus, decoding movements using a linear decoder without hyperparameters remains a significant challenge. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "As our goal is to extract latent dynamics that are most informative about movements, we chose to train the latent dynamics using movements as the target. Several recent studies have trained latent dynamics to classify different movement directions or positions using variational autoencoders (VAE) [32][14][18] or contrastive learning [27][1]. In this paper, we are inspired by the fact that many features, including movements, are continuous, and that the function of many biological neurons is not classification but regression. For example, neurons exhibit monotonic tuning to light intensity and sound levels [2][24]. Even for discrete features like faces, face cells exhibit ramp-shaped tuning to different features[8]. Additionally, $75\\%$ of faces could be correctly decoded using a linear regression decoder[4]. Thus, we trained latent dynamics to regress movement by minimizing the ranking loss.

Nonlinear methods like uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) [19] and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) [28] are extensively used in biological data, such as for identifying neuron cell types [17]. These methods reveal identities but often collapse temporal dynamics that resemble neural trajectories. UMAP with labels has been applied for dimensionality reduction in recent studies [27, 32]. Generative methods using recurrent neural networks or Transformers, such as latent factor analysis via dynamical systems (LFADS) [21], AutoLFADS [15], RADICaL [33], and Neural Data Transformer (NDT) [30].

The difference between the two methods became even more pronounced when they were trained on all three directions combined: NER displayed latent dynamics for straight movements that were surrounded by those formed by curved movements. The explained variance achieved by NER was also higher than that of CEBRA across all three angles, especially on the combined angles (Fig. 17c). Finally, we tested a more challenging condition where all six reaching movements were curved (Fig.8g). In the latent space, two curved movements in the same direction produced close but distinct latent dynamics (Fig.8h).
