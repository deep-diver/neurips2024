This bias limits their applicability in many areas dealing with high-frequency data, such as image processing and signal analysis.  Existing methods for mitigating spectral bias have shown limited success, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data. \nThis paper introduces Multi-Grade Deep Learning (MGDL), a novel approach that tackles spectral bias by incrementally learning a function through multiple grades, each grade focusing on low-frequency components.  By composing the low-frequency information learned in each grade, MGDL effectively captures high-frequency features. The authors demonstrate MGDL's efficacy on various datasets, showcasing its ability to overcome the limitations of single-grade methods.  **MGDL offers a new, effective strategy to address the spectral bias problem, enhancing the performance and generalizability of DNNs in numerous applications.**", "affiliation": "Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Old Dominion University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "IoRT7EhFap/podcast.wav"}
