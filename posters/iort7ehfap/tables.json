For each setting, it shows the maximum (tmax) and minimum (tmin) learning rates used, the batch size, training time in seconds, and the relative squared error (RSE) on the training, validation, and testing datasets (TrRSE, VaRSE, and TeRSE respectively). The RSE values demonstrate the accuracy of each model, with lower RSE representing higher accuracy.  The comparison shows that MGDL achieves significantly lower RSE values across all settings, indicating that it is superior in learning the target functions.", "section": "3 Numerical Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "IoRT7EhFap/tables/tables_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Accuracy comparison: SGDL versus MGDL.", "description": "This table presents the results of comparing the performance of SGDL and MGDL in four different settings.  Each setting varies the parameters q (related to the complexity of the manifold) and the method used (SGDL or MGDL). The table shows the maximum and minimum learning rates used (tmax, tmin), the batch size, training time, and three relative squared error (RSE) values: training RSE (TrRSE), validation RSE (VaRSE), and testing RSE (TeRSE). These values indicate the accuracy of the models in each setting, with lower values indicating better performance. The results show that MGDL generally outperforms SGDL in terms of testing accuracy, especially in settings with more complex manifolds (q = 0).", "section": "3.2 Regression on the manifold data"}, {"figure_path": "IoRT7EhFap/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: PSNR comparison: SGDL versus MGDL.", "description": "This table presents a comparison of the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values obtained from Single Grade Deep Learning (SGDL) and Multi-Grade Deep Learning (MGDL) for three images: 'cat', 'sea', and 'building'.  For each image, it shows the PSNR values obtained for both SGDL and MGDL with different numbers of grades (1 to 4 for MGDL). It also indicates the learning rate, training time, training PSNR, and testing PSNR.  This allows for a direct comparison of the performance of SGDL and MGDL in image reconstruction tasks, highlighting the benefits of the MGDL approach, particularly in higher grades where high-frequency components are captured.", "section": "3.3 Regression on two-dimensional colored Images"}, {"figure_path": "IoRT7EhFap/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 4: Accuracy comparison: SGDL versus MGDL with \u03b2 = 1.", "description": "This table presents the comparison of the accuracy of SGDL and MGDL methods for different frequencies (\u03ba) when the amplitude (\u03b2) is set to 1.
