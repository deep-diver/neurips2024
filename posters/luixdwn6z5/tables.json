It includes the optimizer used (Adam), learning rate, discount factor, regularization coefficient, target smoothing coefficient, replay buffer size, number of critic networks, number of hidden layers and units per layer in the networks, the number of samples per minibatch, and the activation function used (ReLU).  These hyperparameters are crucial for the performance and stability of both algorithms.", "section": "H Details of the experiment"}]
