These methods typically alternate between diffusion steps and gradient steps for loss-guided optimization, resulting in suboptimal results.  They are also sensitive to initialization, and performance drops significantly when using fewer function evaluations. \nTrust Sampling tackles these issues with a novel approach. Instead of alternating between steps, it formulates each diffusion timestep as an independent optimization problem. This allows for multiple gradient steps on a proxy constraint function, continuing until the proxy becomes unreliable. Additionally, it incorporates a method for early termination when the sample diverges from the model's state manifold.  This approach leads to improved generation quality and efficiency across diverse domains (images and 3D motion), significantly outperforming existing methods in terms of fidelity and constraint satisfaction, even with fewer computations.", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "dJUb9XRoZI/podcast.wav"}
