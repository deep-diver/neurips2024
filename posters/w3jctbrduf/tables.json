[{"figure_path": "w3JCTBRduf/tables/tables_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Plot of the distortion obtained through optimization over 5000 iterations vs the average distortion using a random Gaussian matrix (left plot), and the progression of variance over the same number of iterations (right plot). To calculate the distortions' progression with our method, we sample from the updated mean matrix and variance at each iteration and compute the distortion. We remark that the distortion plotted is a proxy for our objective in Equation 4. We observe that our optimization-based approach converges to a deterministic solution sampler. By using the mean matrix M, we achieve nearly optimal distortion, where ||Mx|| \u2248 ||x||.", "description": "This figure shows two plots. The left plot compares the distortion obtained using the proposed optimization-based method over 5000 iterations with the average and minimum distortion obtained using a random Gaussian matrix.  The right plot illustrates how the variance of the Gaussian distribution changes over the 5000 iterations. The results demonstrate that the proposed method converges to a deterministic solution sampler, achieving near-optimal distortion.", "section": "Simulations"}]
