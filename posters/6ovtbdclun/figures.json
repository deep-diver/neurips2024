The cross-view data pairs are contaminated by both false positive and negative correspondences, and the clean and noisy correspondence is mixed. (b) Top: Context-based Semantic Mining. The existing studies estimate the data affinity based on the data representation and might neglect the out-of-neighborhood yet semantically-associated false negatives. In contrast, we formulate the affinity from one data point to all the others as the context and use them for similarity induction, thus benefiting the false negative uncovering in a global manner; Bottom: Spectral-based Correspondence Denoising. Borrowing from spectral decomposition for signal denoising, we employ spectral denoising on the contextual affinity graph to prevent false positives from dominating the model optimization. In the figure, the thickness of the black arrows represents the association strength between two data points.", "description": "This figure illustrates the problem of Dual Noisy Correspondence (DNC) in contrastive multi-view clustering and the proposed solution.
