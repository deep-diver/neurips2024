In brief, DNC involves both the false positive correspondences that arise during data collection, and the false negative correspondences that are inherent in the random sampling of contrastive MvC. To address this issue, we present CANDY comprising two novel modules: Context-based Semantic Mining (CSM) and Spectralbased Correspondence Denoising (SCD). On the one hand, CSM dexterously leverages contextual information to transform distinct views into a common contextual affinity space, thereby uncovering the semantically-associated false negatives. On the other hand, SCD refines the pseudo target to mitigate the adverse impact of false positives by using the spectral denoising technique. By integrating these models, our method provides a plug-and-play solution that could enhance the robustness of the most contrastive MvC methods against DNC. Extensive experiments on a broad spectrum of scenarios have validated the effectiveness of CANDY. In the future, we plan to extend CANDY to address more practical scenarios, such as simultaneously handling both noisy correspondence and missing modalities.
