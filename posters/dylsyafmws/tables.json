It shows the Area Under the Curve (AUC) and True Positive Rate (TPR) at a 0.1% False Positive Rate (FPR) for both the loss and zlib metrics.  The results are broken down by the different values of k (the drop frequency parameter in the goldfish loss) and compared to a standard loss model. The higher the AUC and TPR, the more successful the attack. The results demonstrate that the goldfish loss, particularly at smaller values of k, makes the membership inference attacks less effective than on models trained with standard loss.", "section": "6.1 Membership Inference Attacks"}]
