[{"figure_path": "Ke3MSP8Nr6/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Algorithm 1: Predictor via Pairwise Hypothesis Testing", "description": "Algorithm 1 presents a prediction rule for online classification with noisy labels.  It leverages pairwise hypothesis testing, iteratively refining a set of candidate hypotheses (St) based on cumulative loss vectors (vi[j]).  For each time step, a hypothesis is sampled from St, a prediction is made, and a noisy label is received. The algorithm updates St+1 by removing hypotheses with cumulative losses exceeding a threshold (C), effectively focusing on more promising hypotheses. The algorithm's core is a reduction from a general online classification problem into a set of pairwise classification subproblems which are independently solvable. This makes the algorithm robust and agnostic to adversarial choices of noisy labels.", "section": "3.1 Reduction to Pairwise Comparison: a Generic Approach"}, {"figure_path": "Ke3MSP8Nr6/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Illustration of Lemma 1. The hyperplane perpendicular to line segment p - q* at q* separates Q and p. Therefore, the degree of angle formed by p - q* - q is greater than \u03c0/2. By the law of cosines, L\u00b2(q, p) > L\u00b2(q, q*) + L\u00b2(q*, p) = L\u00b2(q, q*) + \u03b3.", "description": "Lemma 1 states that if a point p is outside of a convex set Q, then the squared L2 distance between p and its closest point q* in Q is less than the squared L2 distance between any other point q in Q and p.  The figure illustrates this geometrically, showing that the angle formed by points p, q*, and any other point q in Q is greater than 90 degrees. This is because the hyperplane perpendicular to the line segment connecting p and q* at point q* separates p from the set Q.", "section": "4 Tighter Bounds for Binary Labels via L2 Gap"}]
