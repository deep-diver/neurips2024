Online learning, where data arrives sequentially, adds another layer of complexity.  Existing research primarily focuses on the 'agnostic' setting, evaluating performance on observed noisy labels rather than the true labels, overlooking the critical issue of achieving good performance on the ground truth. This paper addresses this gap by studying online classification where true labels are corrupted by stochastic noise modeled via a general noisy kernel, and features are generated adversarially. The goal is to minimize the minimax risk when comparing against the true labels. \nThe paper introduces a novel online learning framework that models general noisy mechanisms.  The researchers use a novel reduction to an online comparison of two hypotheses and a new conditional version of Le Cam-Birg\u00e9 testing. Their key finding is that the minimax risk is characterized by the Hellinger gap of the noisy label distributions, independent of other properties of the noise such as the means and variances. This is significant because it provides a clear and comprehensive characterization of the problem, going beyond simpler noise models and offering new insights into the fundamental limits of online classification with noisy labels.", "affiliation": "CSOI, Purdue University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "Ke3MSP8Nr6/podcast.wav"}
