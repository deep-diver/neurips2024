For the latent model, L stands for linear mechanisms whereas NL stands for nonlinear mechanisms; G stands for Gaussian noise whereas NG stands for non-Gaussian noise; Discrete refers to discrete causal variables. Here, we summarize the identifiability results in terms of latent causal graph identification.", "description": "This table compares the identifiability results of the proposed method with those of existing methods in causal disentanglement.  The comparison is based on several factors: the type of data used (counterfactual, interventional, or purely observational), the type of latent model (linear or nonlinear), the nature of the mixing function between latent and observed variables (linear or nonlinear), and the achieved level of identifiability. The identifiability results are described in terms of the ability to fully identify the latent causal graph, identify it up to a specific equivalence class (e.g., Markov equivalence), or identify only blocks of the graph.", "section": "1.1 Related Work"}, {"figure_path": "M20p6tq9Hq/tables/tables_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Mean absolute correlation of the exogenous noise estimates using score estimations.", "description": "This table presents the mean absolute correlation (MAC) between the true and estimated exogenous noise variables in simulations using different sample sizes and score estimation methods (Oracle, Stein, SSM-VR).  The Oracle method uses perfect score estimation, providing a baseline.  The Stein and SSM-VR methods use data-driven score estimation techniques, reflecting a more realistic setting.", "section": "5 Numerical Results"}]
