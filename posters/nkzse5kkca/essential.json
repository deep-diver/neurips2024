This limitation stems from biases in text encoding that overlooks motion and inadequate conditioning mechanisms in T2V models.  The lack of accurate motion representation in text hinders the generation of dynamic and compelling videos. \nThis paper introduces DEMO, a novel framework to address these issues by decomposing both text encoding and conditioning into content and motion components. This allows the model to better understand and represent static elements and dynamic motions separately.  Crucially, DEMO incorporates text-motion and video-motion supervision to enhance motion understanding and generation, ultimately leading to videos with enhanced motion dynamics and high visual quality.  The evaluations on various benchmarks showcase DEMO's superior performance in generating videos with realistic and complex motion, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in T2V generation. **The core contribution is a novel framework that effectively leverages decomposed text encoding and conditioning, along with specialized supervision techniques, to generate videos with substantially improved motion.**", "affiliation": "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "nkzSE5KkCA/podcast.wav"}
