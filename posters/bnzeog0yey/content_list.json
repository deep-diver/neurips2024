I-Div transfers the sampling patterns from the test distribution to the training distribution by estimating density and likelihood ratios.

It suggests that a hypothesis selected by an algorithm, after observing several training samples, should perform effectively on test samples from the same unknown distribution. However, this assumption often oversimplifies the intricate and diverse nature of real-world data, particularly in non-IID scenarios [1, 2]. Thus, if training samples are considered in-distribution (ID), there is a risk that test samples may deviate from this distribution, characterized as out-of-distribution (OOD) [3]. This distribution discrepancy between training and test distributions poses a critical and challenging non-IID learning [2] question: How to quantify the applicability of a hypothesis derived from training samples to test samples?. This question is generally applicable to areas like OOD generalization [4], OOD detection [5, 6], domain adaptation [7, 8], transfer learning [9], semi-supervised learning [10], robust learning [11], and adversarial learning [12].

Furthermore, density ratio methods [18, 19] offer a partial solution by disregarding label information and estimating the ratio between input distributions. Moreover, more performance prediction techniques [20] aim to navigate this challenge by examining the uncertain outcomes of the hypothesis, potentially leading to unreliable results.

We progressively introduce noise into a dataset that serves as the training one, treating the resultant corrupted samples as the test dataset.

To conduct this experiment, CIFAR10 serves as the training dataset, with incremental addition of noises to the original dataset to create the test dataset. The types of noises [46] used include Gaussian, Salt & Pepper, Uniform, and Speckle, with the noise rate increasing from 0.1 to 0.9 with a 0.1 interval. The methods for comparison include Hypothesis-oriented Density Ratio (HDR) in I-Div and R-Div [47]. Fig. 1 presents our experimental findings, showing key performance metrics as influenced by varying noise rates. Notably, the classification performance declines with increasing noise, impacting the hypothesis predictive accuracy. Interestingly, our proposed I-Div algorithm demonstrates robustness against these challenges, with its discrimination power inversely related to the classification accuracy of the standard network in noisy conditions. A brief comparative analysis hints at the superior performance of I-Div over HDR, especially in relation to hypothesis applicability in noisy test datasets. Fig. 4 in Appendix D.3 shows the results when noise is added to the training data instead of the test data.

Building on ME, MMD-O [51] calculates Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) using a Gaussian kernel [52], while MMD-D [53] enhances the performance of MMD-O by substituting the Gaussian Kernel with a learnable deep kernel. In contrast, Classifier Two-Sample Tests, including C2ST-S [54] and C2ST-L [55], classify samples from one dataset as positive and from another as negative, leveraging the classification accuracy of a binary classifier to differentiate between them. H-Divergence (H-Div) [20] identifies optimal hypotheses for both the mixture distribution and individual distributions within a specific model, positing that if two distributions are identical, the expected risk on the training samples from the mixture distribution exceeds that from each individual distribution. R-Divergence (R-Div) [47] tackles the overftiting problem of H-Div by suggesting that two distributions are likely identical if their optimal hypotheses yield the same expected risk for each. However, to estimate the discrepancy between training and test distributions, the aforementioned methods assume symmetry between these datasets, meaning either both sets are labeled or both are unlabeled.

The Kullback-Leibler Importance Estimation Procedure (KLIEP) [19] seeks an importance estimate to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the true test input density to its estimate. Least-Squares Importance Fitting (LSIF) [57] addresses the direct importance estimation issue as a least-squares function fitting problem, transforming the optimization challenge into a convex quadratic program, which is solvable efficiently with standard quadratic programming solvers. Non-Negative Bregman Divergence (NNBD) [58] employs deep neural networks alongside empirical Bregman divergence minimization, addressing the train-loss hacking issue by adjusting the empirical Bregman divergence estimator. Although these methods can estimate the distribution discrepancy between test and training inputs by calculating the density ratio even when class labels for test samples are not available, this implies disregarding the class labels of the training data. Consequently, such density ratios are not suitable for evaluating the applicability of a hypothesis.

Average Thresholded Confidence (ATC) [60] identifies a threshold such that the proportion of training samples exceeding this confidence threshold aligns with their accuracy, and then it predicts accuracy as the proportion of unlabeled test samples surpassing this threshold. Agreement-on-the-Line (AL) [61] capitalizes on the observation that if the accuracy of models on training samples linearly correlates with their accuracy on test samples, then a similar linear relationship exists between the training and test agreement of model predictions. Projection Norm (PN) [62] employs model predictions to pseudo-label test samples and trains a new model on these pseudo-labels. The variation in parameters between this new model and the original model is utilized to estimate the test error. The aforementioned algorithms estimate the effectiveness of a hypothesis selected from the training samples on test samples based on the confidence output of the hypothesis to judge its applicability. However, since the hypothesis is chosen based on a limited set of training samples, it exhibits significant uncertainty towards unseen test samples, especially when these test samples are OOD, leading to misleading results.

This suggests that, even when the classification performance of the standard network is compromised, I-Div still perceives the knowledge from training dataset as transferable to the test dataset. This finding underscores the need to focus on improving the generalization of a standard network to adversarial samples, corroborating our empirical understanding and existing knowledge in the field. Fig. 2(b) presents the AUROC of HDR, which remains high across various perturbation magnitudes, indicating its effectiveness in distinguishing original and adversarial samples.

This indicates that R-Div could potentially be used to assess the hypothesis applicability to the test dataset.
