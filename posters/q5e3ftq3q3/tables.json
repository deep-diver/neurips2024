Panel (a) shows a comparison of the sample complexity of PS\u025bBAI+ versus the naive baseline algorithm, N\u025bBAI, across multiple problem instances. The plot demonstrates that PS\u025bBAI+ achieves significantly lower sample complexity than N\u025bBAI.  Panel (b) illustrates the number of context samples required for best arm identification by PS\u025bBAI+, N\u025bBAI, D\u025bBAI, and D\u025bBAI\u03b2 as a function of the squared relaxed mean gap, 1/(\u2206min + \u025b)\u00b2.  This panel highlights the efficiency gains of PS\u025bBAI+ compared to the other methods, especially given its lack of access to contextual information.", "section": "Numerical Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "Q5e3ftQ3q3/tables/tables_44_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Experimental results", "description": "Figure 2 presents experimental results comparing the sample complexity of PS\u025bBAI+ and N\u025bBAI algorithms.
