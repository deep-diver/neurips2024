The hyperparameters control aspects of the search for adversarial token sequences, including the length of the sequences considered, the number of iterations run, the number of candidate tokens considered at each position in a sequence, and the annealing schedule for the temperature parameter.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "UXuBzWoZGK/tables/tables_13_1.jpg", "caption": "Table A.1: A summary of the proof strategy for Theorem 5.", "description": "This table summarizes the proof strategy for Theorem 5 by dividing the range of V into four regions and explaining why the contribution of each region to the conditional expectation E[V|X+V>t] is small in the limit as t goes to infinity. The regions are defined in terms of a function h(t) that slowly goes to infinity. The explanation for each region relies on the relative likelihood of X and V taking on extreme values given the condition X+V>t and the assumed properties of their distributions.", "section": "A.5 Theorem 5"}]
