The metrics used are Chamfer Distance (CD), Point-to-Surface distance (P2S), Normal Consistency (NC), and Contact Precision (CP) at various thresholds (CP). Lower values for CD and P2S indicate better geometric reconstruction accuracy. Higher NC indicates better normal consistency.  Higher CP indicates better contact prediction accuracy.

It shows how different components of the loss function (squared distance and exponential penalty) affect the performance of the model in terms of CD, P2S, NC, and CP metrics.  The ablation study examines four variants: (a) using neither squared distance nor exponential penalty, (b) using squared distance but not exponential penalty, (c) using exponential penalty but not squared distance, and (d) using both. The results indicate the importance of using both components for optimal performance.", "section": "4.4 Results and Analysis"}, {"figure_path": "7su2GfqvmN/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Ablation on the number of views.", "description": "This table shows the results of an ablation study conducted to evaluate the impact of the number of views used for 3D reconstruction on the performance of the proposed method and a baseline method (DMC).
