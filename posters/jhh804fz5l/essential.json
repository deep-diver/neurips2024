While random projections offer a solution by reducing LP size, their solution quality can be suboptimal.  This work explores a novel data-driven approach, learning projection matrices from data to enhance solution quality.\nThe proposed data-driven approach learns projection matrices from training LPs, applies them to new instances to reduce dimensionality before solving.  The paper provides both theoretical generalization bounds, ensuring learned projections generalize well to unseen LPs, and practical learning algorithms. Experiments demonstrate improved solution quality and significantly faster solving times compared to existing methods.", "affiliation": "University of Tokyo", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "jHh804fZ5l/podcast.wav"}
