For each of the eight datasets (three synthetic and five real-world), it shows the number of constraints (m) and the number of variables (n).  These dimensions are crucial in evaluating the scalability and efficiency of different LP-solving methods, especially those using dimensionality reduction techniques.", "section": "Experiments"}]
