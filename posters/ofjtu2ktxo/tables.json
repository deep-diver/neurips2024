For each criterion (e.g., female users aged 30-49 from Kanto/Shizuoka), it shows the number of users included, their average utility (payment) under a truthful strategy, and the percentage of those users who received a positive payment.

For each artist, it shows the fraction of listeners, the average utility obtained under truth-telling conditions, and the fraction of agents who received positive payments in the truth-telling setting.  The results indicate the effectiveness of the bonus-penalty payment mechanism in incentivizing truthful reporting, even when the data deviates from the theoretical assumptions of the Ising model.", "section": "6.2 Last.fm Dataset for Networked Data"}]
