The left panel shows the Wasserstein flow, where some particles get stuck in local minima and do not reach the target distribution (green dots). The right panel illustrates the IFT flow, which allows for the teleportation of particle mass, enabling a more efficient convergence to the target distribution by avoiding local minima.

Atoms are subject to both the transport (Kantorovich) potential and the interaction (repulsive) force from other atoms.", "description": "This figure illustrates the concept of Interaction-Force Transport (IFT) gradient flow.  It shows how atoms (or particles representing probability mass) move under the combined influence of two forces: a transport force (similar to optimal transport) and an interaction force (representing repulsive interactions between particles). The transport force moves particles towards the gradient of the energy functional, whereas the interaction force influences the way that particles move. The overall effect is a gradient flow that is faster than the one produced by the transport force only, potentially leading to better convergence.  The hollow circle indicates a particle which has mass zero.", "section": "3 IFT gradient flows over non-negative and probability measures"}, {"figure_path": "rPgc5brxmT/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Illustration of the IFT gradient flow.
