This makes traditional cover selection methods inefficient and potentially ineffective for modern steganographic applications. \nThis research proposes a novel cover selection framework that addresses these shortcomings. **The proposed method optimizes within the latent space of pre-trained generative models (like DDIM or GANs) to identify cover images ideal for message hiding.**  This approach significantly improves message recovery rates and image quality.  **The study also reveals that effective message hiding predominantly occurs in low-variance image pixels**, mirroring the waterfilling algorithm in parallel Gaussian channels.  This framework is demonstrated using multiple public datasets, showcasing improved performance over existing methods.  **The researchers further evaluate the robustness of their method against common attacks, demonstrating effectiveness in various scenarios.**", "affiliation": "University of Texas at Austin", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "TzzZ5KAEE2/podcast.wav"}
