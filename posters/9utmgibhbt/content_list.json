DDPMs compose a Markovian process that begins in the data domain and gradually adds noise until reaching pure white noise. DDPMs generate highquality samples from complex data distributions by defining an inverse process and training a deep neural network to learn this mapping. However, these models are inefficient because they require many diffusion steps to produce aesthetically pleasing samples. Additionally, unlike generative adversarial networks (GANs), the latent space of diffusion models is less interpretable. In this work, we propose to generalize the denoising diffusion process into an Upsampling Diffusion Probabilistic Model (UDPM). In the forward process, we reduce the latent variable dimension through downsampling, followed by the traditional noise perturbation. As a result, the reverse process gradually denoises and upsamples the latent variable to produce a sample from the data distribution. We formalize the Markovian diffusion processes of UDPM and demonstrate its generation capabilities on the popular FFHQ, AFHQv2, and CIFAR10 datasets. UDPM generates images with as few as three network evaluations, whose overall computational cost is less than a single DDPM or EDM step while achieving an FID score of 6.86. This surpasses current state-of-the-art efficient diffusion models that use a single denoising step for sampling. Additionally, UDPM offers an interpretable and interpolable latent space, which gives it an advantage over traditional DDPMs. Our code is available online: https://github.com/shadyabh/UDPM/ ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "image", "img_path": "9utMGIbHBt/tmp/11b48c4266694a7a234c760f2fc362449c4c44213ead15dac2a8a158d2ae45c3.jpg", "img_caption": ["Figure 1: The Upsampling Diffusion Probabilistic Model (UDPM) scheme for 3 diffusion steps $\\mathit{L}=3$ ).

This is less than two orders of magnitude compared to standard DDPMs: guided diffusion [9] typically requires 1000 iterations, denoising diffusion implicit models [35] require 250 iterations, stable diffusion [29] requires at least 50 iterations with an additional decoder, EDM [18] can reduce the number of steps to 39, and other recent works [24, 25, 10] can sample with 10-20 network evaluations, which is still considerably more than UDPM. Indeed, in [41], an integration of discriminative loss with diffusion models has shown great generation performance while requiring only 2 diffusion steps. Recent works [43, 26, 31] have demonstrated that sampling can be performed with as few as a single denoising diffusion step while maintaining competitive generation performance.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
