They often require significant computation time, hindering their applicability to large datasets.  Moreover, their fixed feature configurations limit their adaptability to diverse data characteristics, leading to reduced discriminatory power and reduced accuracy. \nThis paper proposes LFHSIC, which addresses these issues by introducing learnable Fourier feature pairs.  LFHSIC directly models test power, leading to an optimization objective that can be computed in linear time.  The method shows significant improvements in both efficiency and effectiveness, particularly in high-dimensional settings.  Theoretical analyses guarantee the convergence of the optimization objective and the consistency of the independence tests.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Key Lab of Intelligent Information Processing, and School of Computer Science, Fudan University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Causality"}, "podcast_path": "BEiqNQZIky/podcast.wav"}
