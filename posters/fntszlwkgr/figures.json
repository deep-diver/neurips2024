[{"figure_path": "FNtsZLwkGr/figures/figures_2_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: DASH. A NN, here a neural ODE for gene regulatory dynamics, is traditionally sparsified in a data-centric way (top). Pruning is done based on data alone, the pruning score \u03a9 is a function of the learned weights W. Such sparsified models often do not learn plausible relationships in the data domain. We propose DASH (bottom), which additionally incorporates domain knowledge P into the pruning score \u03a9, yielding sparse networks giving meaningful and useful insights into the domain.", "description": "The figure illustrates the difference between traditional data-centric sparsification and the proposed DASH method. In data-centric sparsification, the pruning score depends only on the learned weights of the neural network.  In contrast, DASH incorporates domain-specific knowledge (prior information P) into the pruning score to obtain sparser, more biologically meaningful models. The figure shows a neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) network as an example, where the network learns the gene regulatory dynamics and this information is represented in the weights (W). The input is the expression of a gene, and the output is its derivative.", "section": "3 Domain-aware pruning with DASH"}, {"figure_path": "FNtsZLwkGr/figures/figures_3_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Results on simulated data.
