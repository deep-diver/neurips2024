Existing methods often fail in outdoor scenarios with low overlap and density variations.\nThe proposed method, INTEGER, addresses these issues by incorporating high-level contextual information for reliable pseudo-label mining using a novel Feature-Geometry Coherence Mining module.  It dynamically adapts a teacher model for each mini-batch, discovering robust pseudo-labels by considering both high-level features and low-level geometry.  Furthermore, Anchor-Based Contrastive Learning and a Mixed-Density Student are used to enhance the feature space robustness and learn density-invariant features.  Extensive experiments demonstrate INTEGER's superior accuracy and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "affiliation": "Fujian Key Laboratory of Sensing and Computing for Smart Cities, Xiamen University, China", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "OCcfKzXded/podcast.wav"}
