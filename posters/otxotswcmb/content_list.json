However, applying a similar approach to real-world objects and scenes is difficult due to a lack of large-scale data. Videos are a potential source for realworld 3D data, but finding diverse yet corresponding views of the same content has shown to be difficult at scale. Furthermore, standard videos come with fixed viewpoints, determined at the time of capture. This restricts the ability to access scenes from a variety of more diverse and potentially useful perspectives. We argue that large scale $360^{\\circ}$ videos can address these limitations to provide: scalable corresponding frames from diverse views.

Therefore, it is difficult to obtain paired images of the scenes or objects from distant locations and diverse views at scale. One solution to this problem is to leverage $360^{\\circ}$ videos. The $360^{\\circ}$ nature allows the views of frames to be rotated such that they contain overlapping content.

On novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction benchmarks ODIN outperforms existing methods without fine-tuning to the target data. While ODIN shows impressive results, we believe that there is further potential in the use of 360-1M and $360^{\\circ}$ video for novel view synthesis as well as other domains such as video generation. For novel view synthesis an exciting next step would be to model dynamics to generate 4D scenes. We will open-source our code, models, and dataset.
