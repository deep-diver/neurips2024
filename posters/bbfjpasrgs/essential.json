Early-exit neural networks (EENNs) aim to speed them up by producing predictions from intermediate layers, but ensuring accuracy is crucial.  A major challenge is determining when it's 'safe' to exit early without significantly impacting performance. This research addresses this by integrating \"risk control\" frameworks with EENNs.  Risk control is a method that guarantees a certain level of prediction quality before allowing an early exit. \nThis paper introduces a novel approach to integrate risk control with EENNs, providing a theoretically grounded method to tune the exiting mechanism. They validate their approach on various tasks (image classification, semantic segmentation, language modeling, image generation, etc.), demonstrating significant computational savings while maintaining user-specified performance levels.  The method is lightweight and can be applied post-hoc to already trained models, making it practical for real-world implementation.  They also improve on prior work for language modeling by enabling less conservative early exiting and achieving larger efficiency gains.", "affiliation": "UvA-Bosch Delta Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "bbFjpasRgs/podcast.wav"}
