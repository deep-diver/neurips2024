The framework's superior performance opens exciting avenues for future research in complex document processing.", "summary": "This paper introduces HVFA, a novel OCR-free document understanding framework using MLLMs and multi-scale visual features, achieving superior performance across various document understanding tasks.", "takeaways": ["A novel OCR-free document understanding framework based on pretrained MLLMs is proposed.", "The Hierarchical Visual Feature Aggregation (HVFA) module efficiently handles multi-scale visual inputs for LLMs.", "A novel instruction tuning task improves the model's text-reading capability by predicting relative text positions."], "tldr": "Current document understanding methods heavily rely on OCR, which struggles with complex layouts and varying font sizes.  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising alternative but face challenges processing multi-scale visual inputs efficiently.  Existing OCR-free methods are computationally expensive or fail to fully capture detailed visual information.\nThis work introduces a novel framework that leverages pretrained MLLMs for OCR-free document understanding.  It uses a Hierarchical Visual Feature Aggregation (HVFA) module to efficiently manage multi-scale visual inputs, balancing information preservation and efficiency.  A new instruction tuning task focusing on predicting relative text positions significantly enhances the model's text reading capabilities.  **Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of this approach across multiple document understanding benchmarks.**", "affiliation": "ECE & 2IPAI, Seoul National University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "PWkjxjgGLP/podcast.wav"}
