While the graph reasoning capability provided by the vision modality may not be as strong as that of the text modality in most cases, relying solely on vision still enables the model to possess basic graph reasoning abilities. Specifically, the model outperforms text-based LLMs in 2 of the 7 tasks (Cycle and BGM) when relying solely on vision. This consistent improvement across all comparison groups demonstrates the potential of the vision modality to excel in certain graph reasoning tasks, leveraging its ability to capture visual patterns like cycles and graph properties such as bipartition.

The visual modality excels at recognizing beneficial substructures or local patterns, which are crucial for effective graph reasoning. For instance, identifying the \"hop number\" is essential for shortest path calculations, recognizing \"leaf nodes\" is vital for topological sorting, and detecting \"cycles\" is necessary to avoid in Hamilton path construction. We extracted these substructures from the GVLQA-Base dataset and manually labeled them. By employing a frozen Vision Transformer (ViT) in the LLaVA framework with a trainable Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) decoder, we achieved identification accuracies of $89.92\\%$ , $95.16\\%$ , and $92.39\\%$ for hop number counting, leaf node identification, and cycle detection, respectively.
