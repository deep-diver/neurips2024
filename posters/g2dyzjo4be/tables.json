[{"figure_path": "G2dYZJO4BE/tables/tables_1_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: Comparison of various distributional robustness frameworks and what kind of assumptions their analysis can account for (with an incomplete list of examples for each framework).", "description": "The table compares four different distributional robustness frameworks: DRO, infinite robustness, finite robustness, and partially identifiable robustness (the authors' contribution). For each framework, it indicates whether the framework's analysis can account for bounded shifts, partial identifiability of causal parameters, and partial identifiability of the robustness set.  A checkmark (\u2713) means the framework accounts for the property; an X means it does not.  The table helps to situate the authors' proposed framework (partially identifiable robustness) within the existing literature and highlights its unique contributions.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
