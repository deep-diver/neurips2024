The SCM describes how observed variables (covariates Xe and target variable Ye) are generated from unobserved variables: additive environmental shifts Ae and confounders H.  The solid circles represent observed variables, while dashed circles represent unobserved variables. Bidirectional arrows indicate that the relationship between two nodes can be in either direction.

(a) The classical scenario where the test shift directions Mseen are contained in the span of training shifts so that the robust risk and thus its minimizer are point-identified.

In the identifiable setting (a), the test shift directions are fully contained within the span of the training shift directions, resulting in the robust risk being point-identified.  However, in the partially identifiable setting (b), test-time shifts introduce new directions, making the robust risk only set-identifiable.
