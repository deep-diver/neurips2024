Methods without extra hyperparameters are marked with dotted lines.", "description": "This figure displays the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) results from various robust learning methods on a synthetic dataset, designed to evaluate their performance under concept shift. The x-axis represents the hyperparameter values (on a logarithmic scale), while the y-axis displays the corresponding RMSE. Each line represents a different method, demonstrating how their performance changes with varying hyperparameter settings. The dotted lines indicate methods without additional hyperparameters, allowing for a comparison against methods with added hyperparameter tuning.", "section": "E.1 An Additional Experiment: Synthetic Dataset"}, {"figure_path": "bOS6WPV0Jf/figures/figures_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Evolution of pseudolabels during MC-PseudoLabel. The first row plots values of pseudolabels against model predictions. The second row plots values of pseudolabels against V. Columns represent different snapshots during optimization.", "description": "This figure visualizes the iterative process of the MC-PseudoLabel algorithm.  The top row shows how the algorithm refines pseudolabels (generated by grouping functions) in relation to the model's predictions across different iterations (Step 0, Step 2, Step 4).  The bottom row shows the same pseudolabels against the spurious variable 'V'. The converging plots in both rows demonstrate how the algorithm iteratively adjusts predictions to achieve multicalibration and invariance, reducing the influence of spurious correlations.", "section": "Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "bOS6WPV0Jf/figures/figures_18_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Accuracy-on-the-line beyond covariate shift: correlation between models' in-distribution and out-of-distribution risks on VesselPower.", "description": "This figure displays the relationship between a model's in-distribution performance (measured by ID validation RMSE) and its out-of-distribution performance (measured by test RMSE) on the VesselPower dataset.  The strong positive correlation (R\u00b2=0.96 for MC-Pseudolabel) indicates that the method's in-distribution performance is a good predictor of its out-of-distribution performance, a phenomenon known as \"accuracy-on-the-line\". This contrasts with other methods which show weaker correlations, suggesting that MC-Pseudolabel generalizes better to out-of-distribution data.", "section": "6.2 Results"}]
