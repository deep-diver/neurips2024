When a randomly initialised neural network is taken in the infinite-width limit, it becomes equivalent to a Gaussian process with the NNGP kernel. A large body of work has focused on improving the predictive accuracy of NNGPs (Novak et al., 2018; Garriga-Alonso et al., 2018; Arora et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020; Li et al., 2019; Shankar et al., 2020; Adlam et al., 2023), but they still fall short of finite neural networks (NNs). One hypothesis is that this is due to the absence of representation learning; the NNGP kernel is a fixed and deterministic function of its inputs (MacKay, 1998; Aitchison, 2020), but finite neural networks fit their top-layer representations to the task; this aspect of learning is considered vital for the success of contemporary deep learning (Bengio et al., 2013; LeCun et al., 2015). Exploring this hypothesis through the development of NNGP-like models equipped with representation learning could deepen our understanding of neural networks. Although there are some theoretical frameworks for representation learning (Dyer & Gur-Ari, 2019; Hanin & Nica, 2019; Aitchison, 2020; Li & Sompolinsky, 2020; Antognini, 2019; Yaida, 2020; Naveh et al., 2020; Zavatone-Veth et al., 2021; Zavatone-Veth & Pehlevan, 2021; Roberts et al., 2021; Naveh & Ringel, 2021; Halverson et al., 2021; Seroussi et al., 2023), they are generally not scalable enough to handle important deep learning datasets like CIFAR-10.

This process is often very slow (Google\u2019s neural tangents library takes 508 GPU hours to compute the Myrtle-10 kernel on CIFAR-10 Google, 2020; Novak et al., 2019), and therefore infeasible for our setting where the model is both deep, and requires thousands of iterations of gradient ascent.

Wherever the ResNet architecture contains a convolution layer, we use a convolutional deep kernel machine layer as described in the loop in Algorithm 1. That is, we apply a base kernel (in our case, the normalised Gaussian kernel described in Shankar et al. (2020), a more efficient / numerically stable alternative to arccos kernels), perform the (kernel) convolution, and then predict the train/test Gram matrix blocks conditioned on the kernel and the inducing Gram matrix block. In place of batch norm we use the batch kernel normalisation approach suggested by Milsom et al. (2024). Skip connections compute convex combinations of the kernel before and after pairs of layers. At the final layer, we average over the remaining spatial locations, forming an additive GP kernel akin to convolutional GPs (van der Wilk et al., 2017) that is used to make the final predictions. A categorical likelihood function is used in the top-layer GP.

In deep kernel learning, a neural network is used to produce rich features which are then passed as inputs into a traditional \u201cshallow\u201d kernel machine, aiming to give the best of both deep learning and kernel methods. Another \u201ckernel learning\u201d method is the \u201cconvolutional kernel machine\u201d (Mairal et al., 2014; Mairal, 2016), which draw theoretical connections between kernel methods and neural networks, though the resulting model is fundamentally a neural-network-like architecture based on features, which distinguishes it from deep kernel machines. Song et al. (2017) also utilised deep neural networks to generate task-specific representations in a more complex model involving an ensemble of RKHS subspace projections. The main difference between deep kernel machines and these other methods is that deep kernel machines do not involve neural networks at any stage; the representations are learned directly as Gram matrices, not features.

Apart from the obvious lack of representation learning in this work, another key difference from our work is that they focus on computing large full-rank kernel matrices and finding approximate solutions using iterative solvers, whilst we use sparse inducing point approximations resulting in smaller kernel matrices, which we then solve exactly.

This can lead to overfitting. In deep Gaussian processes and deep kernel processes, the representations (Gram matrices in the case of deep kernel processes) have continuous distributions with broad support, thereby offering a regularising effect. Our stochastic kernel regularisation scheme can be seen as analogous to sampling the inducing Gram matrix $\\mathbf{G}_{\\mathrm{ii}}^{\\ell}$ in a deep kernel process. Unlike a deep kernel process, the other blocks $\\mathbf{G}_{\\mathrm{ti}}^{\\ell}$ and $\\mathbf{G}_{\\mathrm{tt}}^{\\ell}$ in our model remain deterministic, simplifying the model implementation. Other approaches to regularising kernel methods include \u201ckernel dropout\u201d proposed by Song et al.

In the neural kernel literature, Lee et al.

In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
