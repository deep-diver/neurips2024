The methods compared include a Convolutional Deep Kernel Machine (DKM) from this paper, a Convolutional Deep Kernel Machine from previous work (Milsom et al., 2024), and state-of-the-art methods based on tuned Myrtle10 Kernel and NNGP-LAP-flip, alongside a neural network trained with Adam and another with SGD+Weight Decay for comparison. The table shows that the proposed DKM in this paper achieves comparable performance to a Neural Network trained using Adam and outperforms previous methods.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "prgxz9fYbf/tables/tables_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Test metrics on CIFAR-100 using a DKM and a neural network with the same architecture.

The table compares the test accuracy and test log-likelihood achieved by four different models: the proposed convolutional DKM, a convolutional DKM from prior work, a neural network trained with AdamW, and a neural network trained with SGD and weight decay.  Each result represents the mean and standard error calculated from four independent runs with different random seeds.  The data demonstrates the performance comparison of DKMs and neural networks on a challenging image classification task.

It shows the impact of removing key components of the model, such as the Taylor approximation, stochastic kernel regularization (SKR), and the effect of reducing the number of training epochs.  The test accuracy and log-likelihood are reported, along with the number of times each configuration resulted in a numerical error during training (Failures). This helps to assess the importance of each component to model performance and stability.", "section": "4 Experiments"}]
