It highlights the key semantic features captured by the PCA projections within each leaf's subspace, indicating the words that contribute most strongly to the variation along each of the two principal components (PC1 and PC2). The words provide insights into the themes and characteristics of the reviews grouped within each leaf.", "section": "E Amazon Reviews Dataset"}]
