Thus, rather than producing a global map as in t-SNE and other methods, which often leads to distortions, it produces a hierarchical set of local PCAs. The use of a sparse oblique tree and of PCA in its leaves makes the overall model interpretable and very fast to project or reconstruct new points. Joint optimization of all the parameters in the tree is a nonconvex nondifferentiable problem.

Many DR methods have been proposed over the years. Currently, $t$ -SNE [40] and PCA are the most popular choices and have seen widespread application in many areas. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "Here we advocate for a different approach, that of hierarchical local linear projections, which we call the PCA tree. Hierarchical DR is not new, but what is new is our definition of the model as a certain type of tree autoencoder and our algorithm to learn it by minimizing the reconstruction error in a self-supervised way, which brings considerable advantages in interpretability and training and inference time. From the outset, we acknowledge that DR is a hard, ill-defined problem that no single technique can solve satisfactorily. In reducing a dataset to 2D we necessarily have to lose information and produce artifacts. Indeed, the distortions of $t$ -SNE and their impact on applications have been well documented [6, 22]. However, the PCA tree provides significant, complementary advantages over previous methods. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "Firstly, PCA trees are practical and intuitive to use. They optimize the reconstruction error, which has a clear meaning. They do not require a neighborhood graph (and perplexity parameter, etc.), which is tricky to estimate so it captures manifold structure, and computationally very costly. The model, a tree autoencoder (see later), directly defines nonlinear out-of-sample mappings (encoder and decoder). Its hyperparameters are natural: the depth $\\Delta$ of the tree, which directly controls the resolution (number of scatterplots and reconstruction error), and the sparsity $\\lambda$ , which helps to interpret the tree decision nodes. Inference on a tree (encoding or decoding) is extremely fast. Training (to find a local optimum, a hard problem because the tree is nondifferentiable)is linear on the sample size and parallelizable, hence scalable to large datasets without the need for approximations.

This comes from the fact that both trees and PCA are techniques with well understood interpretability. Specifically: 1) the use of trees to construct a nested hierarchy of maps where an input instance follows a single root-leaf path; 2) the use of sparse oblique trees, with hyperplanes using few features at the decision nodes; 3) the use of linear projections in the leaves, each a PCA scatterplot; and 4) the ability to see the data at multiple scales.

The latter is more likely to introduce distortions in trying to arrange many dimensions into a 2D map, and is hard to use with large datasets, requiring a lot of pan and zoom. This is less of a problem if one focuses on a local part of the data, particularly if there are clusters. Also, a linear projection is easy to understand and, while it does introduce distortions, it is well understood how this happens: distances can only shrink. If a PCA map shows clusters, these are real\u2014in contrast with $t$ -SNE\u2019s tendency to create false clusters [6, 22], for example. Also, PC directions often correspond to some real degree of freedom, and the mean is obviously a useful summary of the data. Thus, while global PCA generally collapses different parts of a manifold, local PCAs can succeed\u2014if properly learned. Multiple local maps are like an album of a house, where each picture shows a different room, but with an hierarchical structure.

", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Non-hierarchical DR Of the many existing DR methods, we mention two large groups that are particularly important in this paper. One are autoencoders, which learn an encoder or projection mapping and a decoder or reconstruction mapping so as to minimize the reconstruction error of each training point. The classic examples are PCA and neural network autoencoders [34, 17], where the encoder and decoder are linear and nonlinear, respectively. Our tree autoencoders are another example. The other are nonlinear embedding methods, which learn the 2D projection of each training point so that Euclidean distances in latent space best match distances or similarities in the high-dimensional space. These include multidimensional scaling [5], SNE [16], $t$ -SNE [40], the elastic embedding [6] and UMAP [28], among others. Although often proposed as matching distributions of neighbors in the high- and low-dimensional spaces, these methods can be equivalently seen as optimizing a tradeoff of attraction between true neighbors and repulsion between points [6, 41, 22]. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Hierarchical DR A multiscale view of DR is an attractive idea that has been explored before, often justified by the fact that a single 2D map may miss much of the structure in a complex dataset. We consider two ways of defining the hierarchical structure: soft and hard. In soft hierarchies, one defines a soft, probabilistic tree [20] so that an input instance traverses every tree path with a positive probability. Thus, the model really is a probabilistic mixture of the leaves (\u201cexperts\u201d) with mixing proportions given by the tree structure. This has the advantage that the model is differentiable, so optimization is straightforward with gradient- or EM-based approaches. Unfortunately, we lose the interpretability and fast training and inference, since an instance reaches all nodes, and the leaves may not localize in input space and overlap with each other. Examples of this are [4, 30, 38, 19]. A more detailed comparison of soft and hard oblique decision trees appears in [12]. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Making the tree decisions hard makes the hierarchy nested, but the optimization is much more difficult (indeed, this is an important contribution in our paper). One can construct a hard hierarchy in a greedy sequential way by recursively partitioning the dataset, or by using some other tree construction (such as kd-trees [11] or cover trees [2]); and then applying some form of DR at each node. However, this is suboptimal (since the node parameters are fixed as they are added, or independently from the leaf parameters) and produces overly large trees. Conversely, one can grow the tree bottomup by a form of hierarchical clustering, but this is also suboptimal. These approaches include work such as [1, 24, 26, 29] and others such as hierarchical self-organizing maps [32], sequential NMF [9] and hierarchical SNE [31].

Also, some fast approximations for graph-based embedding methods are based on tree data structures, such as Barnes-Hut trees [43, 39, 42, 35].

The coordinate axes in the leaves show the most variance in the data within the leaf\u2019s region. Since the RSs are nested along the tree hierarchy, we can also show a scatterplot at each decision node (appendix fig. 9), which shows how classes and other patterns are progressively separated as one descends deeper into the tree.

As expected with PCA, amplified by the fact that it focuses on a region of the whole data, this often shows insights about the intrinsic local structure of the data. In particular, we can usually identify the coordinate axes (PCs) with meaningful quantities or degrees of freedom (labeled in the scatterplot below each leaf in fig. 5). For example, leaves L1, L2, L4, L7, L14, L15 and L16 contain objects of a specific type, such as L1 containing high-heel and high-ankle boots and sandals, or even isolating a class, such as L14 isolating bags. Interestingly, we find all these leaves often detect similar degrees of freedom: usually, PC1 is (overall) pixel intensity in the image and PC2 is object size (either height or width). Again, this is the result of minimizing reconstruction error, which projects along maximum-variance directions. Also, since overall intensity and object size are correlated, this is seen in the PCA plots as triangular shapes whose vertex corresponds to low-intensity images (caused by either overall low intensity or by a very small object). This can be clearly seen in leaf L4 (consisting of T-shirts and tops), as well as in other leaves: L7/L15 intensity-width; L1/L2/L16 intensity-height; L14 intensitysize of bags.

Another example is the fact that the image overall intensity arises throughout the PCA tree leaves as a principal component. This is not surprising: intensity changes in this dataset are large, and thus carry considerable variance, which the local PCAs pick. Even the global PCA is able to pick that too and locate low-intensity images in the lower-left area of the 2D embedding (see appendix fig. 10). However, both $t$ -SNE and UMAP do not; we have verified that low-intensity images are mapped all over the embedding in a haphazard way. A similar effect happens with the Amazon reviews document dataset (appendix section E): individual document classes appear in PCA plots as \u201cstreaks\u201d, caused by the document length (which changes the norm of the TF-IDF feature vector), and converging on the area occupied by short documents.
