Each grey rectangle corresponds to a slice k, where the height is balk and the width sharek. Observe that the height of each rectangle is at most balk \u2264 1/2, and the widths of all rectangles sum to \u2211k\u2208[s] sharek = 1.", "description": "This figure provides a graphical illustration of the balancedness quantile function, a key concept in the paper.  The x-axis represents the cumulative market share, and the y-axis represents the balancedness of each slice. Each rectangle represents a slice (k) in the market. The width of the rectangle corresponds to the market share of that slice (sharek), and the height corresponds to its balancedness (balk). The figure visually demonstrates how the balancedness quantile function aggregates the balancedness across different slices to characterize the overall efficiency of the market.", "section": "3.1 The Balancedness Parametrization"}]
