It compares different models (linear and non-parametric) and assumptions about the noise distribution (e.g., known, parametric, Lipschitz continuous).  The regret bounds represent the performance of different pricing algorithms, indicating how much revenue is lost compared to an optimal strategy.", "section": "1.1 Related Work"}]
