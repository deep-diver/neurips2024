The left panel shows the regret (the difference between the optimal revenue and the actual revenue obtained) against the time horizon (number of pricing decisions) on a linear scale. The right panel shows the same data but using a logarithmic scale for the y-axis (regret). The solid lines represent the average regret over 15 repetitions of the algorithm, while the shaded area represents the standard error.  A dotted line in the right panel represents the theoretical regret bound derived from the theoretical analysis.", "section": "A Simulations"}, {"figure_path": "iMEAHXDiNP/figures/figures_12_2.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: The two subplots show a comparison between VAPE and the algorithm in [14] in the stochastic and adversarial case, where the time horizons used are T \u2208 [1000, 1700, 3000, 5000] (left subplot), and T\u2208 [1000, 1400, 4200, 9000] (right subplot). In both cases the solid lines represent the average of the regret rates across the 15 repetitions of the simulations, while the faded area the standard error. In the subplot on the right, due to the specificity of the setting, the variance across runs is minimal, hence the faded area results invisible. The regret graph is in both cases plotted in logaritmic scale.", "description": "The figure compares the performance of the proposed VAPE algorithm and the algorithm from Fan et al. [14] in both stochastic and adversarial settings for dynamic pricing.  Two subplots display the results: the left shows the stochastic case, and the right displays the adversarial case. The x-axis represents the time horizon (T), while the y-axis shows the logarithm of the regret. Each line represents the average regret across 15 simulations, with the shaded region indicating the standard error. The adversarial setting has a minimal variance, resulting in an invisible shaded region in its subplot.  The logarithmic scale is used to improve visualization of the results.", "section": "A Simulations"}]
