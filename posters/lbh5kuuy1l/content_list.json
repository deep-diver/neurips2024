Conditional 3D structure-based drug design (3DSBDD) models, which take into account complex three-dimensional interactions and molecular geometries, are particularly promising. Scaffold hopping is an efficient strategy that facilitates the identification of similar active compounds by strategically modifying the core structure of molecules, effectively narrowing the wide chemical space and enhancing the discovery of drug-like products. However, the practical application of 3D-SBDD generative models is hampered by their slow processing speeds. To address this bottleneck, we introduce TurboHopp, an accelerated pocket-conditioned 3D scaffold hopping model that merges the strategic effectiveness of traditional scaffold hopping with rapid generation capabilities of consistency models. This synergy not only enhances efficiency but also significantly boosts generation speeds, achieving up to 30 times faster inference speed as well as superior generation quality compared to existing diffusion-based models, establishing TurboHopp as a powerful tool in drug discovery. Supported by faster inference speed, we further optimize our model, using Reinforcement Learning for Consistency Models (RLCM), to output desirable molecules. We demonstrate the broad applicability of TurboHopp across multiple drug discovery scenarios, underscoring its potential in diverse molecular settings.

Recent strides in molecular design have introduced advanced generative models that excel in de-novo generation and optimization within 3D molecular space (Isert et al. [2023]). Despite these technological advances, challenges persist, such as ensuring synthesizability (Gao et al. [2021], Fialkov\u00e1 et al. [2021]) and maintaining desirable drug-like properties. The scarcity of protein-ligand complex data further complicates these demanding issues. While 1D/2D models attempt to address these challenges though various methods (Loeffler et al. [2024]), they often fall short in representing true 3D structures, and typically necessitating additional steps for proper conformation generation. On the other hand, 3D models (Ragoza et al. [2022], Luo et al. [2022], Baillif et al. [2023], Peng et al. [2022]), which directly incorporate spatial structures, show greater promise in activity prediction regarding 3D structures but are hindered by significantly slower inference speeds (Baillif et al. [2023]), which limit their practical applications such as fine-tuning via Reinforcement Learning (Ding and Jin [2024], Baillif et al. [2023], Wallace et al. [2023]). Recent research efforts, such as those by Lee and Cho [2024], have started fine-tuning 3D-autoregressive models with specialized reward functions to align with these stringent standards. Yet, notably absent are attempts involving Structure-Based Drug Design Diffusion Models(3D-SBDD DMs), as the prolonged inference times remain a formidable barrier, precluding the adoption of similar methodologies. In this work, we address this gap by successfully applying reinforcement learning to 3D-SBDD DMs, overcoming the challenge of prolonged inference times and demonstrating the feasibility of such approaches in practical drug design scenarios.

Addressing these speed limitations is critical for several reasons. Primarily, faster processing speeds are essential for accelerating hit discovery phases, which could significantly increase the likelihood of identifying quality hits within a shorter time period. Additionally, the high computational demands of these models not only escalate costs but also limit access to advanced optimization techniques, thereby restricting the generation of molecules with desirable properties such as synthesizability, high binding affinity, and drug-likeness. Furthermore, real-time applications, such as interactive modeling sessions with human experts, require rapid model inference to provide effective feedback and facilitate iterative testing (Sundin et al. [2022]). By enhancing the speed of these models, it may be possible to enable real-time applications, allowing for on-the-fly modifications and adaptations during interactive sessions.

In contrast, TurboHopp had a major increase in all metrics with a small downside of increased generation time of only a few seconds. This is possible due to the fact that there are less steps required to generate during multi-step generation, thus less steps to evaluate afterwards.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
