Existing algorithms often struggle to balance exploration and exploitation effectively, leading to suboptimal regret bounds.  Furthermore,  many existing algorithms are computationally expensive, hindering their applicability to real-world problems. \nThis work addresses these challenges by developing two novel algorithms.  OLS-UCB-C, a deterministic algorithm, leverages online estimations of the covariance structure to achieve improved regret bounds. COS-V, a sampling-based algorithm inspired by Thompson Sampling, offers improved computational efficiency while still maintaining a near-optimal regret bound. Both algorithms provide gap-free regret bounds, showcasing their effectiveness across various problem sizes.  The research highlights the practical benefits of adapting to the problem's structure and the efficiency gains achievable through sampling methods. ", "affiliation": "Univ.
