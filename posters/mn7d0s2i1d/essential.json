Existing robust learners often require strong assumptions on the model and are computationally expensive, especially in high dimensions.  The difficulty stems from the non-convex optimization landscape of SIMs and the potential for label noise to significantly impact the learning process. \nThis paper introduces a new algorithm that addresses these challenges. The algorithm uses a gradient-based method combined with tensor decomposition to tackle the inherent non-convexity of SIMs. It is computationally efficient and provides robust learning even with significant label noise.  The algorithm's sample complexity is close to optimal, making it particularly useful for high-dimensional datasets. This work is relevant to a wide range of machine learning applications where robust learning and efficiency are essential.", "affiliation": "University of Wisconsin, Madison", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Robustness"}, "podcast_path": "MN7d0S2i1d/podcast.wav"}
