On the opposite, intelligent processes in nature arises without the need for such collections, but simply by on-line processing of the environmental information. In particular, natural learning processes rely on mechanisms where data representation and learning are intertwined in such a way to respect spatiotemporal locality. This paper shows that such a feature arises from a pre-algorithmic view of learning that is inspired by related studies in Theoretical Physics. We show that the algorithmic interpretation of the derived \u201claws of learning\u201d, which takes the structure of Hamiltonian equations, reduces to Backpropagation when the speed of propagation goes to infinity. This opens the doors to machine learning studies based on full on-line information processing that are based on the replacement of Backpropagation with the proposed spatiotemporal local algorithm.

In particular, we assume that learning and inference develop jointly under a nature based protocol of environmental interactions and then we suggest developing computational learning schemes regardless of biological solutions. Basically, the agent is not given the privilege of recording the temporal stream, but only to represent it properly by appropriate abstraction mechanisms. While the agent can obviously use its internal memory for storing those representations, we assume that it cannot access data collection. Instead, the agent can only rely on buffers of limited size to retain the information it acquires. From a cognitive perspective, these small buffers allow the agent to review recent inputs backward in time, implementing a form of selective attention.

We formulate the continuous learning problem to emphasize how optimization theory brings out solutions based on differential equations that recall similar laws in nature. The discrete counterpart [2, p. 2], which is more similar to recurrent neural network algorithms that are found in the literature, can be derived as a numerical method and applied in practical scenarios like lifelong learning with long video streams [4], where an Euler method for the differential equations can serve as an \u201coptimizer\u201d for RNN weights. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the online computation described in this paper achieves spatiotemporal locality, thereby contributing to the longstanding debate on the biological plausibility of Backpropagation [8, 33, 21]. Specifically, we address the update locking problem and the issue of infinitely fast signal propagation in neural networks. Finally, the paper shows that the conquest of locality opens up a fundamental problem, namely that of approximating the solution of Hamilton\u2019s equations with boundary conditions using only initial conditions. A few insights on the solution of this problem are given for the task of tracking in optimal control, which opens the doors of a massive investigation of the proposed approach.

Then the dynamical equation $\\dot{x}(t)=f(x(t),{\\boldsymbol w}(t))$ does not represent a constraint on variational problems for functional in (9). If we look at the Hamilton equation for $\\dot{p}_{x}$ in (12) this reduces to $\\dot{p}_{x}\\,=\\,-p_{x}\\cdot\\,f_{\\omega}$ . We would however expect $p_{x}(t)\\equiv0$ for all $t\\in[0,T]$ . Indeed this is the solution that we would find if we pair $\\dot{p}_{x}\\,=\\,-p_{x}\\cdot f_{\\omega}$ with its boundary condition $p_{x}(T)=0$ in (13). Notice that in general without this condition a random Cauchy initialization of this equation would not give null solution for the $p_{x}$ . Now assume that $\\phi=\\exp(\\theta t)$ with $\\theta\\,>\\,0$ , and $m\\,=\\,1$ . Assume, furthermore5 that $V(\\omega,s)\\,=\\,|\\omega|^{2}/2$ . The functional $\\textstyle\\int_{0}^{T}(|{\\dot{w}}|/2+|w|^{2}/2)e^{\\theta t}d t$ defined over the functional space6 $H^{1}([0,T];\\mathbb{R}^{N})$ is coercive and lower-semicontinuous, and hence admits a minimum (see [11]). Furthermore one can prove (see [20]) that such minimum is actually $C^{\\infty}([0,T];\\mathbb{R}^{N})$ . This allows us to describe such minumum with the Hamilton equations described in (12). In particular as we already commented the relevant equations are only that for $\\dot{\\pmb w}$ and $\\dot{p}_{w}$ that is $\\dot{\\pmb{w}}(t)\\dot{=}-p_{\\pmb{w}}(t)e^{-\\theta t}$ and $\\dot{p}_{\\pmb{w}}(t)=-{\\pmb w}e^{\\theta t}$ with $p_{\\pmb{w}}(T)=0$ . This first order system of equations is equivalent to the second order differential equation $\\ddot{{\\pmb w}}(t)+\\theta\\dot{{\\pmb w}}(t)-{\\pmb w}(t)=0$ . Each component of this second order system will, in general have an unstable behaviour since one of the eigenvalues is always real and positive.

The paper gives two main contributions. First, it introduces a local spatiotemporal pre-algorithmic framework that is inspired to classic Hamiltonian equations. It is shown that the corresponding algorithmic formalization leads to the interpretation of Backpropagation as a limit case of the proposed diffusion process in case of infinite velocity. This sheds light on the longstanding discussion on the biological plausibility of Backpropagation, since the proposed computational scheme is local in both space and time. This strong result is indissolubly intertwined with a strong limitation. The theory enables such a locality under the assumption that the associated ordinary differential equations are solved as a boundary problem. The second result of the paper is that of proposing a method for approximating the solution of the Hamiltonian problem with boundary conditions by using Cauchy\u2019s initial conditions. In particular we show that we can stabilize the learning process by appropriate schemes of time reversal that are related to focus of attention mechanisms. We provide experimental evidence of the effect of the proposed Hamiltonian Sign Flip policy for problems of tracking in automatic control. While the proposed local propagation scheme is optimal in the temporal setting and overcomes the limitations of classic related learning algorithms like BPTT and RTRL, the given results show that there is no free lunch: The distinguishing feature of spatiotemporal locality needs to be sustained by appropriate movement policies into the Hamiltonian Track. We expect that other solutions better than the HSF policy herein proposed can be developed when dealing with real-word problems and may offer potential approaches to classic challenges in lifelong learning, such as forgetting, that remain open and are not fully addressed by the current framework. This paper must only be regarded as a theoretical contribution which offers a new pre-algorithmic view of neural propagation. While the provided experiments support the theory, the application to real-world problems need to activate substantial joint research efforts on different application domains.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
