Many existing approaches lack explicit constraints on object movement, hindering optimization and performance.  They often rely solely on appearance-based supervision for dynamic scene reconstruction. This makes them susceptible to optimization difficulties and degraded performance, especially when object movements are irregular or complex. \nMotionGS tackles these challenges by incorporating explicit motion priors to guide 3D Gaussian deformation.  It achieves this by decoupling optical flow into camera and object motion, allowing for precise motion guidance.  Furthermore, a camera pose refinement module iteratively optimizes 3D Gaussians and camera poses, mitigating the impact of inaccurate initial camera estimates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MotionGS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, showcasing its effectiveness and robustness in handling complex dynamic scenes.  This approach offers a significant advancement in accurate and efficient dynamic scene reconstruction.", "affiliation": "University of Science and Technology of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "6FTlHaxCpR/podcast.wav"}
