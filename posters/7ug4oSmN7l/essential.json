Traditional metaheuristic methods struggle with the high computational cost and scalability issues of CARP, especially with large-scale instances.  Neural network based approaches offer potential solutions but have so far lagged behind metaheuristics in terms of solution quality. This paper addresses this limitation.\nThis paper introduces a novel neural network based solver for CARP. The proposed approach, called DaAM (Direction Aware Attention Model), uses a combination of supervised pre-training and reinforcement learning to effectively solve the problem. The DaAM model incorporates directionality into the embedding process, leading to better one-stage decision making. A path optimization method is also employed to refine the solutions further.  The results of the experiments show that DaAM outperforms heuristic methods and achieves comparable or better results compared to state-of-the-art metaheuristics, while achieving drastically reduced computation times. This makes DaAM a significant advancement in solving CARP.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "7ug4oSmN7l/podcast.wav"}
