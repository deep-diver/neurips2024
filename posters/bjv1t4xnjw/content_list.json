These weaknesses render them incapable of scaling up to long-range videos. Additionally, hardware parallelization for video object-centric learning has been explored in [56], however, it incurs quadratic cost unlike ours. Our SlotSSMs framework can be specialized to address object-centric learning tasks effectively. By integrating SSMs at its core, SlotSSMs benefti from parallelizable training and possess remarkable long-term memory capabilities.

It also paves the way for future research in modular and object-centric sequence modeling. However, it has some limitations that future studies could address. First, compared to Transformer architectures, we find that SlotSSMs could benefit more from a pre-training phase in visual reasoning tasks. For example, in the 3D visual reasoning task, SlotSSMs underperform Transformer models when trained without pretraining. However, when combined with task-free pretraining, SlotSSMs demonstrate significant improvement, enabling them to outperform Transformer models. We note that this effect of task-free pre-training is more prominent in SlotSSMs than in Transformer baselines. This suggests that for tasks with sparse training signals, the sequential nature of SlotSSM performs better with a pre-training phase to learn to effectively utilize information from all time steps. We believe this phenomenon is worth further investigation in future research. Second, although the proposed architecture is not only applicable to video modeling but also to other modalities like text, we have not explored this aspect in this study. It remains a matter for future work. Thrid, due to our academic research lab\u2019s computing resource constraints, we were unable to significantly scale up the proposed model to industry-scale in terms of model size and data size. Lastly, future studies should investigate the effect of increased visual complexity in videos. To this end, in Appendix D.2, we present a preliminary study applying SlotSSMs to natural videos, demonstrating how modularity emerges from SlotSSMs\u2019 independent mechanisms in real-world scenes. We hope these findings will inspire future research on the industry-scale adoption of SlotSSMs. ", "page_idx": 15}, {"type": "text", "text": "Impact Statement The introduction of SlotSSMs, a novel framework that incorporates independent mechanisms into State Space Models (SSMs), has the potential to significantly impact the field of sequence modeling. By leveraging the modular structure inherent in many real-world processes, SlotSSMs offers a more intuitive and effective approach to modeling long-range temporal dependencies in object-centric video understanding and prediction tasks. The substantial performance gains demonstrated by SlotSSMs over existing sequence modeling methods highlight the importance of designing architectures that align with the underlying structure of the problem domain. This breakthrough could lead to the development of more efficient and accurate models for a wide range of applications, such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and video surveillance systems. Moreover, the success of SlotSSMs in capturing the modular nature of real-world processes could inspire further research into modular and object-centric sequence modeling. This could result in the development of even more advanced architectures that can better handle the complexity and diversity of real-world data. Because this is a general backbone architecture for sequence modeling, it doesn\u2019t raise direct ethical concerns. However, its ethical implications depend on the way downstream application developers use the model.
