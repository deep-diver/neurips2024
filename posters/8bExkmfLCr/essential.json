Current algorithms for solving these problems are limited, posing a significant challenge. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a novel Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) method called JOBCD.\n\nJOBCD is designed to efficiently handle the J-orthogonality constraints. The paper explores two variants: GS-JOBCD (using a Gauss-Seidel strategy) and VR-J-JOBCD (using a variance-reduced Jacobi strategy).  Both variants' theoretical convergence is proven, with VR-J-JOBCD offering improved oracle complexity through variance reduction techniques.  Extensive experiments on various real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that JOBCD consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its effectiveness and efficiency.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "8bExkmfLCr/podcast.wav"}
