It shows the performance of each method on various datasets with varying parameters.  The best-performing methods are highlighted using color-coding. A '+' symbol next to an entry indicates that GS-JOBCD significantly improved the results from the CSDM method.  The values in parentheses represent the differences from the J-orthogonality constraint, XJX-J.", "section": "5 Applications and Numerical Experiments"}]
