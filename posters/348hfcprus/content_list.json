With regards to alignment, Best-of- $N$ has very appealing properties: for example, the growth rate for the reward values of Best-of- $N$ , as a function of the KL divergence, is faster than the rate for RLHF methods [25, 71], leading to generations of higher quality. Best-of- $\\mathcal{N}$ also plays a critical role in some post-training techniques: it is commonly used to generate a high-quality dataset for later supervised fine-tuning [64, 21], a procedure sometimes called Expert Iteration or Iterative Finetuning, one that played a key role in the alignment of Llama-2 [64] and Llama-3 [44].

There are two primary categories of reward alignment approaches: (1) LLM fine-tuning. This method involves updating the weights of the base model. Techniques within this category include reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [48, 14, 51], direct preference optimization (DPO) [50], and their respective variants [23, 76, 4, 72, 55, 78, 77, 36, 45].

Examples of this category include ARGS [32], controlled decoding [45], Best-of- $\\mathcal{N}$ , and associated applications such as Expert Iteration [21, 25, 64]. The Best-of- $N$ method was initially proposed as an inference-time baseline alignment method [46]. Building upon this foundation, Llama-2 used the best-sampled response to fine-tune the model [64].

Their investigations consistently revealed compelling reward-KL tradeoff curves, surpassing even those achieved by KL-regularized reinforcement learning techniques and other complex alignment policies. Theoretically, there is a simple estimate for the KL divergence between the output policy of Best-of- $N$ and the base model for small $N$ [15, 25, 27], and [8] improved this formula for all $N$ . [71] showed that Best-of- $N$ and KL-regularized RL methods enjoy equal asymptotic expected reward and their KL deviation is close.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
