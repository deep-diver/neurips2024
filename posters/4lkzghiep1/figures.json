The tree's structure reflects the asymmetry of information available to the learner and adversary due to strategic manipulation.", "section": "The Strategic Littlestone Dimension"}, {"figure_path": "4Lkzghiep1/figures/figures_16_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: A Strategic Littlestone Tree with depth 2.

The tree shows how an adversary can create either false positive or false negative mistakes by strategically choosing agents' features, and the learner only observes the manipulated features. False negative edges (red) represent cases where the agent does not manipulate their features, while false positive edges (blue) indicate manipulation by the agent.  The consistency rules ensure that there exists a classifier in the hypothesis class that is consistent with all paths in the tree.  The depth of the tree corresponds to the number of mistakes the adversary can force the learner to make.", "section": "The Strategic Littlestone Dimension"}]
