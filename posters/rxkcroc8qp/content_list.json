In this study, we present an end-to-end EEG-based visual reconstruction zero-shot framework, consisting of a tailored brain encoder, called the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM), which projects neural signals from different sources into the shared subspace as the clip embedding, and a two-stage multi-pipe EEG-to-image generation strategy.

A blurry image also decoded from EEG for maintaining the lowlevel feature. In stage two, we input both the high-level clip embedding, the blurry image and caption from EEG latent to a pre-trained diffusion model.
