The \"Training data source\" column shows what kind of data (simulated agent populations or human data) was used to train each method. The final two columns show the average scores achieved by each method in two specific Overcooked layouts: \"Counter Circuit\" and \"Multi-strategy Counter\".

The p-values indicate the probability of observing the results obtained if there is no real difference between the methods being compared.  Lower p-values suggest stronger evidence that a difference exists.
