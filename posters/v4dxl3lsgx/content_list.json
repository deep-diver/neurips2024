Current algorithms focus on training simulated human partner policies which are then used to train a Cooperator agent. The simulated human is produced either through behavior cloning over a dataset of human cooperation behavior, or by using MARL to create a population of simulated agents. However, these approaches often struggle to produce a Cooperator that can coordinate well with real humans, since the simulated humans fail to cover the diverse strategies and styles employed by people in the real world. We show learning a generative model of human partners can effectively address this issue. Our model learns a latent variable representation of the human that can be regarded as encoding the human\u2019s unique strategy, intention, experience, or style. This generative model can be flexibly trained from any (human or neural policy) agent interaction data. By sampling from the latent space, we can use the generative model to produce different partners to train Cooperator agents.

While being cooperative is a notable characteristic of human intelligence [7, 32], training an artificial agent that cooperates well with humans poses a significant challenge. Human behaviors are uncertain and diverse, encompassing a wide range of preferences, abilities, and intentions. While humans can rapidly adapt to different partners, AI agents are particularly poor at generalizing to working with a novel human partner. Solving this issue of distribution shift between the human player\u2019s strategy and those seen during the training of an AI agent is crucial to achieving human-AI cooperation.

While this may certainly provide some leverage, in many situations the amount of human-human data available is far less than the amount of data required by data-hungry sequential decision making algorithms. This suggests that we need a way to generate synthetic data at scale, while still providing relevance to the problem of coordinating with new, real human teammates on deployment. On the opposite end is the paradigm of self-play, that generates entirely synthetic data by iteratively training agents against copies of themselves. Self-play, while initially envisioned as a paradigm for learning how to compete with novel human players [27, 33], has been applied to cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning to find joint strategies for a team of agents when all agents are trained together [10, 23]. Self-play is an appealing approach for learning cooperative strategies, since it can be done in simulation, and does not require the expensive and time-consuming process of collecting and training on human cooperation data [1]. However, agents trained with self-play may fail to coordinate effectively with novel humans [1, 29]. During self-play, the agent learns to form a convention with a copy of itself and relies on that convention to achieve seamless cooperation [6]. When a human adopts a different strategy at test time, the agent fails to adapt, and merely continues to follow the convention formed in training. Such scenarios are fairly common, as self-play often generates \u201cnon-human\u201d conventions [1, 11].

The goal of this work is often to create a diverse enough population of agents to cover the strategy space used by humans [2, 24, 37]. However, the bottom line remains that truly covering the space of strategies with discrete samples of strategies can quickly become untenable. As we move towards more complex real-world tasks, with a myriad of possible strategies, representing every strategy by an individual agent in the population and coordinating with them becomes computationally difficult.

Therefore, we propose to train a generative model of partner behavior using a variational autoencoder (VAE) [12] on a collection of coordination trajectories, either human or synthetically generated. The inference model of the VAE can be used to infer the latent variable $z$ of a partner from its interaction data, encoding information about that partner\u2019s unique style or skill levels. The decoder can be used to generate the corresponding actions taken by the partner.

Building cooperative agents that generalize well to humans and novel partners is a long-standing problem of AI, and is known as ad-hoc team-play [28], or zero-shot coordination [11]. Recently, FCP [29] adopted the idea of using a population of policies to train a strong zero-shot Cooperator agent, as a diverse population effectively prevents the Cooperator from exploiting one specific convention. Following this framework, many techniques [2, 37] have been proposed to improve the diversity of the population, such as Maximum Entropy Population (MEP)[40]. Reward shaping [30, 37] and quality diversity [22, 31, 35] utilize domain knowledge to create agents with diverse behaviors. Statistical diversity based on trajectory distributions [19] or population entropy [40] are straightforward optimization objectives. However, as indicated in [2], agents with different behavior distributions do not necessarily use different high-level strategies. To address this, the LIPO algorithm [2] instead tries to minimize the cross-play reward between different agents in the population to encourage them to form incompatible conventions. However, because LIPO agents can potentially sabotage the game, follow-up works [3, 24] propose strategies for preventing this, including Cross-play Optimized, Mixed-play Enforced Diversity (CoMeDi) [24]. While this extensive literature presents different population creation methods, in contrast we propose a novel approach to modeling this population with a generative model, and thus benefit the training process through the ability to flexibly sample unlimited new partners. Our experiments directly compare to FCP [29], CoMeDi [24], and MEP [40], and show that GAMMA can enhance performance above each of these population-generation techniques, even using the same underlying population of simulated agents, while also allowing for the incorporation of human data.

Their methods require a manually-designed or predefined set of all possible partner policies. The idea of embedding-conditioned agent modeling is used in imitation learning [14] to learn more interpretable policies from human demonstrations. Grover et al. [5] train a latent variable model to learn agent representations from interaction data of different agents, and then infer a cooperation partner\u2019s latent vector and use it to condition a multi-agent RL policy.

We run a user study with real human players in order to determine which method can most effectively coordinate with humans, and which method is rated as subjectively better by humans (H3). We conducted a study with 80 users recruited via online crowdsourcing from Prolific. Our study follows guidelines set by a UW IRB protocol. During the study, each user is instructed to play multiple rounds of Overcooked with a partner via a web interface, where in each round the partner is an agent following one of the 9 policies, in randomized order. We trained 5 random seeds per agent, and used a different randomly-selected seed for each of the $9P P$ game rounds. For the human study, we focus on the most complex layouts, Counter Circuit and Multi-strategy Counter. Each game lasts for 60 seconds. After each round, the user answers Likert scale survey questions [16] to rate their experience playing with the agent. At the end of the 8 rounds, humans also answer qualitative questions about the performance of the agents. Users are required to pass an attention check to ensure quality of their data. Using these answers, we conduct a qualitative analysis to understand which factors most heavily influence overall performance and users\u2019 preferences when playing with real humans.

At first, we hypothesize this is because the second layout is more complex, but the number of human coordination trajectories available for training ( $N=11$ ) is significantly less than the first layout $N=37$ ). With more diverse potential strategies and less human data, we find the data is insufficient to fully fine-tune the generative model for the second layout. Since the entire model is fully fine-tuned, there is a higher chance that the model overftis the training human samples when the amount of human data is extremely small. Therefore, we believe the results of the FFT model could be improved were we to collect more data. However, it is realistic to test the scenario where limited human data is available, since human data can be quite expensive and difficult to collect.
