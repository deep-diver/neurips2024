Existing methods for training cooperative AI agents often struggle to generalize well to real humans because simulated human partners do not fully capture the variability in actual human behaviors. This often leads to poor performance when tested with real human partners. \nThe paper proposes a novel method called GAMMA (Generative Agent Modeling for Multi-agent Adaptation) that addresses this issue by learning a generative model of human partners. This generative model can simulate a wide range of human behaviors and strategies to train a cooperative AI agent.  The key contribution is the incorporation of both simulated and real human interaction data to create a more versatile and human-like partner model for training. The experimental results, performed in the Overcooked game, show significant performance improvements with GAMMA compared to previous approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in promoting robust and adaptable human-AI collaboration.", "affiliation": "University of Washington", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Gaming"}, "podcast_path": "v4dXL3LsGX/podcast.wav"}
