Current solutions like advanced prompting techniques require substantial, high-quality data for effective fine-tuning, which is often limited.  Self-correction and self-learning approaches are emerging as alternatives, but their effectiveness remains questionable, especially in complex scenarios.  This is particularly challenging because assessing the quality of an LLM's response, especially in tasks requiring intricate reasoning, remains a difficult problem.\nThis paper introduces ALPHALLM, a novel framework for LLM self-improvement that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with LLMs.  ALPHALLM addresses data scarcity by generating synthetic prompts; enhances search efficiency through a tailored MCTS approach, \u03b7MCTS, and provides precise feedback using a trio of critic models.  Experiments in mathematical reasoning demonstrate ALPHALLM's significant performance improvement over base LLMs without additional annotations, showcasing the potential of self-improvement in LLMs and offering a promising solution to the challenges of data scarcity and complex reasoning.", "affiliation": "Tencent AI Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "tPdJ2qHkOB/podcast.wav"}
