One crucial part of self-improving is how to obtain reliable signal of critique to distinguish between good responses from the LLM and bad ones. Initial work (Bai et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022) first asks the LLM to generate input queries of diverse tasks and the corresponding outputs. They then rely on hand-crafted heuristic rules to filter out redundant or low-quality data pairs (e.g. the query is too long or too short). Since it is non-trivial to compose effective heuristic rule, later work (Sun et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2024) proposes a few general principles or judging criteria and ask the LLM itself to evaluate the quality its responses based on these guidance, hoping that LLMs can automatically designate these principles into each data point to better guide data filtering. However, this requires LLMs to have strong abilities to apply these principles for each specific case and make correct judgements. Different from previous work, we propose to leverage the supervision from MCTS for LLM self-improvement: taking the outputs of MCTS to continue train the LLM.

Therefore, we propose to incorporate PRM that introduces process supervision (Lightman et al., 2023) for direct option assessment. PRM generates intrinsic rewards (Chentanez et al., 2004) to encourage explorations of advantageous options, effectively mitigating issues of reward sparsity by providing immediate, action-specific rewards. Given a state $\\scriptstyle s_{t}$ and an option $\\pmb{o}_{t}$ at time $t$ , the PRM aims to predict the immediate reward $r_{t}^{\\mathrm{PRM}}$ that results from taking option $\\pmb{o}_{t}$ in state $s_{t}$ . Formally, the PRM is a function $R(s_{t},\\mathbf o_{t})\\to r_{t}^{\\mathsf{P R M}}$ . While PRM ideally requires quality labels for each state (Uesato et al., 2022), due to the high cost and time involved in obtaining these, MC estimation with prefix sampling (Wang et al., 2023) is used as a proxy, which aligns with the objective of the value function. Instead of adding a MLP layer on top of the policy model for outputting a scalar reward (Ouyang et al., 2022), we formulate PRM as a text generation task to best leverage LLM\u2019s intrinsic knowledge for assessing the quality of an option. We adapt the dataset constructed for the value function as $\\mathcal{D}_{\\sf P R M}=\\{(s_{i t}^{\\sf},o_{t},\\bar{r}_{t}^{\\sf P R M})|\\dot{\\iota}\\in[N],\\dot{t}\\in[T]\\}$ where $\\boldsymbol{r}_{t}^{\\mathrm{PRM}}$ is the textual description of the reward, e.g., an option can be regarded as good if $v_{i t}$ is larger than certain threshold. To train PRM, we initialize it from the policy model $\\pi$ and use the following prompt templates and typical language model loss. The prompt template is shown in Appendix A.5. ", "page_idx": 5}, {"type": "text", "text": "", "page_idx": 6}, {"type": "text", "text": "ORM In additional to the value function and PRM, ORM is also used to guide MCTS. ORM is designed to evaluate options sequences in their entirety, assessing the extent to which the complete trajectory aligns with the desired end goal (Uesato et al., 2022; Lightman et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Feng et al., 2023). The outcome evaluation complements value function and PRM by offering a comprehensive assessment of trajectories. Crucially, ORM plays a vital role in the simulation stage of MCTS by providing more accurate signals on the terminal state, which in turn facilitates a more balance between exploration and exploitation strategies. ORM is formulated as a text generation task, similar to PRM. We leverage the same dataset for the value function training and construct ${\\cal D}_{0\\mathtt{R M}}\\,=\\,\\{(\\pmb{x}_{i},\\pmb{o}_{1:T}^{i},r_{i}^{0\\mathtt{R M}})|i\\,\\in\\,[\\bar{N}]\\}$ , where each instance includes a initial state or prompt $\\pmb{x}_{i}$ , a sequence of actions or options $o_{1:T}^{i}$ taken from that state, and a textual reward $r_{i}^{0\\mathrm{RM}}$ indicating the sequence\u2019s success or quality.

For GSM8K, we utilize the whole test set while for MATH, due to computation constraints, we utilize a subset following the same procedure of Lightman et al. (2023). We evaluate the performance of predicting answers correctly for policy models. In addition, we calculate the average rollouts, represented by the number of nodes in the tree, as a measure of computational efficiency. We compare the performance of ALPHALLM with a suite of proprietary model, including OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, Anthropic\u2019s Claude-2, as well as Google\u2019s PaLM-2 and the gemini model family. To ensure a fair and consistent evaluation, we employ CoT as our primary prompting method.

Both PRM and ORM are initialized using the weights from the policy model, while the value function uses a smaller Llama-2-13b model, as we observed no performance gains from increasing the value function model size. In the design of ORM, tool usage is not incorporated for GSM8K. However, for MATH, we enhance ORM by incorporating tools like python sympy to assess the quality of a trajectory, in a manner similar to that described by Gou et al. (2023). The training employ a learning rate of 1e-6 and are trained for one epoch. For the fast rollout policy model, we opt for the Abel-002-7B model (Chern et al., 2023) for both the GSM8K and MATH tasks for its high efficiency and superior performance.

This indicates that the full potential of MCTS for self-improvement in LLMs has not yet been fully realized.

Addressing these concerns could lead to more significant improvemens. $(i i i)$ In our existing framework, the critic models remain static.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
