This is mainly due to the limited scope of reference images used during personalization, leading to poor adaptation to source image layouts and a lack of data diversity that causes the model to collapse to the patterns learned from limited reference images.  These issues necessitate higher level of editability than what personalized generation requires.\nDreamSteerer tackles this challenge by introducing a novel plug-in method that enhances the source image-conditioned editability. **It employs Editability Driven Score Distillation (EDSD) and mode-shifting regularization to improve editing fidelity and avoid mode trapping**.  The method also includes modifications to the Delta Denoising Score framework that allow for high-fidelity editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamSteerer significantly improves editability across different T2I personalization baselines while remaining computationally efficient.", "affiliation": "Australian National University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "UekHycx0lz/podcast.wav"}
