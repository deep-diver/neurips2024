However, their transferability (performing well on large graphs after training on smaller ones) and stability (resistance to data and graph perturbations) are not fully understood. Existing GNN research primarily focuses on single-graph scenarios, ignoring scenarios where a set of entities is represented by multiple graphs, each showing a different perspective. This limitation hinders the applicability of GNNs in multimodal contexts, such as recommendation systems or multimodal social network analysis. \nThis paper addresses these issues by introducing the concept of graph-tuple neural networks (GtNNs) and providing a rigorous mathematical theory to analyze their stability and transferability. GtNNs operate on multiple graphs that share the same vertices and consider non-commuting operators which makes the analysis very challenging. By leveraging the properties of non-commutative non-expansive operators, the authors develop a limiting theory for graphon-tuple neural networks and establish a universal transferability theorem, guaranteeing that GtNNs can effectively transfer knowledge learned on smaller graphs to larger graphs. Moreover, they propose a training algorithm that demonstrably enhances the stability of the GtNNs.  The paper substantiates its findings with simple experiments on synthetic and real-world data, showcasing tight bounds between theoretical and empirical results.
