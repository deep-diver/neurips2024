Such networks act on functions on the vertices of a graph (also called signals or vertex features) and use the structure of the graph as a powerful inductive bias to describe the natural flow of information among vertices. One of the most common graph neural networks are based on graph convolutions [14], which generalize the notion of message passing. The typical architecture has building blocks which are polynomial functions of the adjacency matrix (or more generally of the shift operator) of a graph composed with componentwise non-linearities. Therefore, such networks implement the idea that the values of a function at a vertex are related with the values at the immediate neighbors of the vertex and also with the values at the neighbors of its neighbors, etc. ", "page_idx": 0}, {"type": "text", "text": "", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "Due to the significant practical success and diversity of applications of GNNs, there is a growing interest in understanding their mathematical properties. Researchers have delved into various theoretical aspects of MPNNs, including, for instance, expressivity [35, 47, 9, 1, 8], oversmoothing [44], multi-scale properties [18, 5], and model relaxations [12, 17]. One of the fundamental properties of graph neural networks is their remarkable transferability property, which intuitively refers to their ability to perform well in large networks when trained in smaller networks, thus transfering knowledge from one to the other. This is in part possible because the number of parameters that defines a GNN is independent of the size of the input graphs. The idea is conceptually related to the algebraic notion of representation stability that has been recently studied in the context of machine learning models [28]. More precisely, if two graphs describe similar phenomena, then a given GNN should have similar repercussions (i.e. similar effect on similar signals) on both graphs. In order to describe this property precisely, it is necessary to place signals and shift operators on different graphs (of potentially different sizes) in an equal footing to allow for meaningful comparisons and to characterize families of graphs describing \u201csimilar\u201d phenomena. The seminal work [40] has used the theory of graphons to carry out these two steps, providing a solid theoretical foundation to the transferability properties of GNNs. The theory was further developed in [27, 41, 32, 23, 10], and was extended to other models in [6, 26, 43]. The transferability theory is very related to the stability or perturbation theory of GNNs that studies how GNN outputs change under small perturbations of the graph input or graph signal [42, 7, 13, 22], and conceptually related to the theory of generalization for GNNs [46, 11, 29, 33, 31] though the techniques are different.

The setting in this paper could be thought of as a special case of this theory. However, there is a crucial difference: whereas the main results in the articles above refer to the Hilbert-Schmidt norm, we define and analyze block-operator-norms on non-commutative algebras acting on function spaces. This choice allows us to prove stronger stability and transferability bounds that when restricted to classical GNNs improve upon or complement the state-of-the-art theory. In particular, we complement work in [42] by delivering bounds that do not exhibit no-transferable energy, and we complement results in [32] by providing stability bounds that do not require convergence.

This architecture replaces the polynomials $h(X)$ underlying graph convolutional neural networks with non-commutative polynomials $h(X_{1},\\ldots,{X_{k}})$ on the adjacency matrices of the $k$ graphs in our tuple. More generally our approach via operator networks gives a general and widely applicable parametrization for such networks.

This means that whatever a GtNN learns on a graph-tuple with sufficiently many vertices, instantaneously transfers with small error to all other graph-tuples of sufficiently large size provided the graph-tuples we are considering describe a \u201csimilar\u201d phenomenon in the sense that they have a common graphon-tuple limit.

On the other hand objects that are close in the natural norm in this space should correspond to graphs describing \u201csimilar\u201d phenomena. As shown in [41], both of these challenges can be solved simultaneously by the theory of graphons.

We use the publicly available MovieLens 100k database, a collection of movie ratings given by a set of 1000 users [39] to 1700 movies. Our objective is to interpolate ratings among users: starting from the ratings given by a small set of users to a certain movie, we wish to predict the rating given to this movie by all the remaining users. Following [19] we center the data (by removing the mean rating of each user from all its ratings) and try to learn a deviation from the mean rating function.

More specifically we compute two shift operators $T_{1},T_{2}$ by connecting each user to the 10 and 15 most correlated other users respectively, and compare the performance of the GtNN on the tuple $(T_{1},T_{2})$ (2ONN) with the best between the GNNs on each of the individual operators $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ (GNN).

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
