Existing methods often suffer from high memory consumption and slow computation times, hindering their practical use in large-scale deep learning.  Many hyper-parameters and additional features further complicate analysis and development. \nThis research presents a novel approach based on tensor networks (TNs) to represent convolutions. By viewing convolutions as TNs and leveraging the einsum library for efficient evaluation, the authors demonstrate significant speedups up to 4.5x for a recently proposed KFAC variant while substantially reducing memory usage.  They derive concise formulas for various autodiff operations and curvature approximations and provide transformations that simplify computations, thus making the exploration of algorithmic ideas far easier.  The TN implementation also enables a new hardware-efficient tensor dropout method.", "affiliation": "Vector Institute", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "cDS8WxnMVP/podcast.wav"}
