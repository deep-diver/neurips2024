These methods attempt to disentangle object geometry, materials, and lighting from images, often using gradient-based optimization through differentiable rendering which is noisy and unstable.  These challenges hinder efficient and reliable 3D relighting for various applications.\nThe proposed IllumiNeRF method overcomes these issues by employing a two-stage process. First, it preprocesses input images using a relighting diffusion model conditioned on target lighting and estimated geometry to generate multiple plausible relit images. Then, it trains a latent NeRF on these relit images to produce a consistent 3D representation, enabling the rendering of novel views under target illumination. This novel approach improves both efficiency and accuracy, setting a new state-of-the-art in relightable 3D reconstruction.", "affiliation": "Google Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "k6m3y6qnSj/podcast.wav"}
