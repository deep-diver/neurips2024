The methods are zero-shot using CLIP (no training on the specific dataset), training from scratch (training a model only on the private dataset), full finetuning (pretraining on public data then finetuning on private data), and linear probing (using pretrained features and a linear classifier on private data).  The results demonstrate the effectiveness of using public pretrained features, especially with linear probing, even in scenarios with large distribution shifts between public and private data.", "section": "4.1 Datasets"}]
