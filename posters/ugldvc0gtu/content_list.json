", "page_idx": 6}, {"type": "text", "text": "In these experiments, LangDT and LISA exhibit the lowest performance, even for the cases without contexts. This is attributed to the multi-modality in the dataset, which tends to hinder the learning of policies built with multi-layer perceptrons or transformers. In contrast, the baselines employing diffusion models, such as Diffuser and LCD, show improved performance. However, none of these baselines achieve robust comparable performance to LDuS for the cases involving language or multi-modal contexts. This limitation arises because the baselines are primarily designed to handle goal descriptions, which is the sole form of language annotation in the dataset. Consequently, they lack the capability to accommodate various contexts that convey environmental conditions or user requirements. Diffuser and LCD, when used with guidance, exhibit slightly improved CR, as the hand-designed optimal loss function can provide context-aligned guidance for trajectory generation. However, in some cases, SR slightly decreases for both the baselines and LDuS when guidance is applied. This decrease occurs because the gradient-based loss-guidance could generate unexpected trajectories unless the tuning of the guidance weight $\\delta$ was carefully managed. Overall, LDuS outperforms the baselines in CR by employing the iterative refinement that ensures context alignment, as well as in SR by employing the sequential in-painting that allows for robust trajectory generation.

At test-time, given a specific context describing environmental conditions or user requirements, LDuS directly influences the generation process of the skill diffusion planner, allowing for skill-based policies to adapt to the context. This zeroshot adaptation is achieved by a combination of LLM-based loss function generation and iterative refinement, along with the controllable structure of the skill diffusion planner.
