The comparison includes several state-of-the-art methods, categorized by their approach (gradient-based, learning-based, traditional). Metrics used for comparison are CD (Chamfer distance), F-score, RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MedAE (Median Absolute Error), LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity), SSIM (Structural Similarity Index), and PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio). Lower values for CD, RMSE, MedAE, and LPIPS are better; higher values for F-score, SSIM, and PSNR are better. The table highlights the superior performance of the proposed GeoNLF method across various metrics on both datasets.", "section": "4.2 Comparison in LiDAR NVS"}, {"figure_path": "v3y785TN7B/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 1: NVS Quantitative Comparison on Nuscenes and KITTI-360.
