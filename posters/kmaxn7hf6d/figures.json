The left-hand side shows a class envy-free (CEF) matching, where no class of agents would prefer the items assigned to another class.  The right-hand side depicts a non-wasteful (NW) matching, demonstrating a scenario where items are not allocated to agents who like them, even though it is possible to improve the matching size. The figure illustrates the trade-off between fairness and efficiency in matching problems.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "kMAXN7HF6d/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Impossibility constructions for the upper bound results of Theorems 1.2 and 1.3.

(a) shows a construction demonstrating a tight bound of approximately 0.761 for the indivisible item setting; (b) shows a construction proving a tighter bound of approximately 0.677 for the divisible item setting.

The graph includes two classes of agents (red and blue nodes), and items (white nodes). The connections show which agents like which items. The structure of the graph and the connection is designed to show that even if a matching is class envy-free (CEF) and non-wasteful, it does not necessarily maximize the CNSW objective function.", "section": "A.
