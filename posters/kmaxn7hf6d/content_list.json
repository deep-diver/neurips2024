For indivisible items, such allocations are not guaranteed to exist. As such, two relaxations are commonly studied: envy-freeness up to one item (EF1) [30] and maximin share fairness (MMS) [10]. An allocation that satisfies EF1 is guaranteed to exist when valuations are monotone, and are further PO when agents have additive valuations [12]. However, the existence of MMS allocations is not guaranteed, even for additive valuations. Nevertheless, there are various polynomial time approximation algorithms [17, 18, 22, 20, 36].

A key takeaway from their results is that for a small number of players, the PoF remains relatively low; for example, for two players, the PoF for proportional fairness is at most $8.6\\%$ , and for max-min fairness, it is $11.1\\%$ . [11] further extend these results by examining fairness notions like proportionality, envy-freeness, and equitability for both divisible and indivisible goods and chores. However, as [7] highlight, a significant limitation in the indivisible setting is that the guarantees do not hold for every problem instance, as the results are not framed as a worst-case analysis. To address this, [7] investigate PoF under worst-case scenarios for various fairness criteria, including Nash social welfare, envy-freeness up to one good, balancedness, and egalitarian social welfare.
