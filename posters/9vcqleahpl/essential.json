Existing few-shot learning methods for WSIs either underutilize available data or rely on weak supervision, resulting in suboptimal performance.  This necessitates the development of efficient and effective methods to leverage limited data for accurate WSI analysis.\n\nThe proposed method, FAST, introduces a dual-tier few-shot learning paradigm. It employs a dual-level annotation strategy, minimizing the need for expensive fine-grained annotations.  It also incorporates a dual-branch classification framework \u2013 a cache branch utilizing all patches and a prior branch using a visual-language model.  This approach significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving accuracy comparable to fully supervised methods with a mere 0.22% annotation cost.  **FAST is highly efficient and adaptable**, showcasing its potential for wide-spread adoption in clinical practice.", "affiliation": "Shandong Computer Science Center", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "9vcqleAHPl/podcast.wav"}
