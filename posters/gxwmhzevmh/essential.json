Neural ODE models offer an improvement for irregularly sampled data, but still struggle with long sequences.  Existing methods, such as neural ODE and Transformer models, often exhibit high computational costs, especially when dealing with long sequences.\nThis paper introduces Rough Transformers, a novel approach that leverages path signatures for continuous-time representation of time series.  **The proposed model uses a multi-view signature attention mechanism that extracts both local and global dependencies in the data efficiently.**  Experimental results demonstrate that Rough Transformers outperform state-of-the-art methods on several tasks, achieving substantial computational savings while maintaining accuracy and robustness to irregular sampling.", "affiliation": "University of Oxford", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "gXWmhzeVmh/podcast.wav"}
