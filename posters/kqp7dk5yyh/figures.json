In Step 1, a pre-trained machine learning (ML) model predicts outcomes for both labeled and unlabeled data. Step 2 involves applying standard analysis routines to obtain summary statistics from the labeled data with observed outcomes, labeled data with predicted outcomes, and unlabeled data with predicted outcomes. Finally, Step 3 uses a one-step debiasing technique on these summary statistics to produce valid and efficient ML-assisted inference results.", "section": "3 Methods"}, {"figure_path": "KQp7dk5YYH/figures/figures_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Workflow of PSPS for Task-Agnostic ML-Assisted Inference.", "description": "The figure illustrates the workflow of the Post-Prediction Summary-statistics-based (PSPS) inference method for task-agnostic machine learning (ML)-assisted inference.

Panels (a-c) illustrate the coverage of 95% confidence intervals, indicating whether the true parameter value falls within the calculated interval at the nominal 95% rate.  Panels (d-f) display the width of the 95% confidence intervals for each method, showing the precision of the estimates.
