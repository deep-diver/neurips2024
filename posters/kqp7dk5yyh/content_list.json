In conjunction with classical statistical approaches, ML-assisted analytical strategies have shown great promise in accelerating research findings. This has also opened a whole field of methodological research focusing on integrative approaches that leverage both ML and statistics to tackle data science challenges. One type of study that has quickly gained popularity employs ML to predict unobserved outcomes in massive samples, and then uses predicted outcomes in downstream statistical inference. However, existing methods designed to ensure the validity of this type of post-prediction inference are limited to very basic tasks such as linear regression analysis. This is because any extension of these approaches to new, more sophisticated statistical tasks requires task-specific algebraic derivations and software implementations, which ignores the massive library of existing software tools already developed for the same scientific problem given observed data. This severely constrains the scope of application for post-prediction inference. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel statistical framework named PSPS for task-agnostic ML-assisted inference. It provides a post-prediction inference solution that can be easily plugged into almost any established data analysis routines. It delivers valid and efficient inference that is robust to arbitrary choice of ML model, allowing nearly all existing statistical frameworks to be incorporated into the analysis of ML-predicted data. Through extensive experiments, we showcase our method\u2019s validity, versatility, and superiority compared to existing approaches. Our software is available at https://github.com/qlu-lab/psps.

For example, sophisticated deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in predicting protein structure and interactions, which has the potential to significantly speed up the research process, save costs, and revolutionize the field of structural biology [1, 2, 25]. However, recent studies have pointed out that statistical inference using ML-predicted outcomes may lead to invalid scientific discoveries due to the lack of consideration of ML prediction uncertainty in traditional statistical approaches.

However, with resampling-based inference, the need to manually derive variance is reduced. Instead, resampling methods can be universally applied to many estimation problems and easily obtain variance [17\u201319].

Even for M-estimation tasks that have already been implemented, PSPS offers the additional advantage of relying solely on summary statistics. The \u201ctask-specific derivations\u201d refer not only to statistical tasks but also to scientific tasks. Real-world data analysis in any scientific discipline often involves conventions and nuisances that require careful consideration. For example, our work is partly motivated by GWAS [43]. Statistically, GWAS is a linear regression that regresses an outcome on many genetic variants. While the regressionbased statistical foundation is simple, conducting a valid GWAS requires accounting for numerous technical issues, such as sample relatedness (i.e., study participants may be genetically related) and population structure (i.e., unrelated individuals of the same ancestry are both genetically and phenotypically similar, creating confounded associations in GWAS). Sophisticated algorithms and software have been developed to address these complex issues [31]. It will be very challenging if all these important features need to be reimplemented in an ML-assisted GWAS framework. With our PSPS protocol, researchers can utilize existing tools that are highly optimized for genetic applications to perform ML-assisted GWAS. This adaptability is not just limited to GWAS, but is a major feature of our approach across scientific domains.

Under such conditions, current ML-assisted inference, which relies on accessing both labeled and unlabeled data to minimize a joint loss function, is not feasible.

DXA-BMD is the primary diagnostic marker for osteoporosis and fracture risk [15, 54]. Identifying vQTL for DXA-BMD can provide insights into the biological mechanisms underlying outcome plasticity and reveal candidate genetic variants involved in potential gene-gene and gene-environment interactions [29, 32, 45, 47, 49]. We focused on total body DXA-BMD, which integrates measurements from multiple skeletal sites. We used data from the UK Biobank [13], which includes 36,971 labeled and 319,548 unlabeled samples with 9,450,880 genetic variants after quality control. We predicted DXA-BMD values in both labeled and unlabeled samples using SoftImpute [30] with 466 other variables measured in the UK Biobank.

Our protocol involves initially generating summary statistics using computationally efficient software tools in scientific data analysis, followed by integration of summary statistics to produce ML-assisted inference results, which achieves high computational efficiency while maintaining statistical validity. Future work could focus on developing a fast resampling algorithm to further improve computational efficiency.
