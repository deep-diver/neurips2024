In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) philosophy into RGB-E SOT to keep track of targets as well as distractors by using both RGB and event data, thereby improving the robustness of the tracker.

However, the inherent properties of CNNs limit their ability for global information exploration and interaction, thereby constraining the advancement of CNN-based trackers. In response, some CNN-Transformer trackers [33, 5, 28] employ attention mechanisms to establish global dependencies between template features and search features. But these hybrid CNN-Transformer trackers still independently extract features from templates and search regions using CNN networks, resulting in extracted features being unaware of the tracking target. To address this issue, several pure Transformer-based trackers [35, 32, 40] overcome the challenge by unifying feature extraction and feature relation modeling through a single Transformer backbone, leading to state-of-the-art tracking performance.

There are some approaches that aim to enhance the tracking performance of Single Object Tracking (SOT) via the use of an MOT philosophy.
