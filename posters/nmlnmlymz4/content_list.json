Here, we investigate how aligning vision representations to human perceptual judgments impacts their usability across diverse vision tasks. We finetune state-of-the-art models on human similarity judgments for image triplets and evaluate them across standard benchmarks.

In the language domain, we have seen the power of aligning LLMs to human feedback [RLHF; 9], resulting in safer and more useful models [3]. Similar trends are emerging in vision, where there is growing interest in alignment with human perceptual judgments to improve vision representations [e.g., 61, 17, 42, 18, 43]. Human feedback has also been used to improve the aesthetic quality of diffusiongenerated images [58, 16, 30], increase retrieval capabilities [18], and improve downstream task performance of image/text models [42]. While acknowledging this wide space of human preference data used for alignment in vision and language, we focus our study on image similarity judgments, which give us a more stable and shared measure of human visual perception [18, 41, 54, 43].

Does human alignment improve model performance by leveraging human-provided labels as an inductive bias, or compromise the model\u2019s original representational power by diverting it towards a separate task? Recent work suggests that the conclusions are nuanced: naively incorporating human perceptual knowledge into model finetuning can distort representations, requiring strong regularization to maintain downstream performance while increasing the representations\u2019 interpretability and alignment [42]. Furthermore, objective function and training data appear to matter more than architecture or model size for aligning to perceptual judgments [41]. The nature of human preference labels also plays a crucial role, as different types of labels produce distinct learning signals. For instance, fine-tuning vision backbones with mid-level perceptual similarity judgments yields representations well-suited for image retrieval tasks [18], while low-level similarity labels are more effective for image reconstruction losses [61].

Using the intermediate activations of deep networks has been a long-standing strategy, originally used as a way of harnessing data-driven priors from models trained on fewer large datasets and repurposing them for downstream tasks where such expensive supervision is less readily available [12, 50]. For instance, ImageNet pretrained models have proven useful for tasks such as texture synthesis [19], style-transfer [20], and super-resolution [27]. But given the challenges of collecting large-scale labelled datasets using human annotators, other approaches such as self-supervised learning [6, 7, 59, 4, 44] and contrastive learning on image/alt text pairs [46, 8, 26] have since superseded supervised learning as the standard approach for training vision models.

The process of selecting these positive and negative learning examples remains an active research area. Recent approaches have suggested that alternative strategies including hard-negative mining [47], nearest neighbors for positive pairs [14], and supervised labels when available [28] can provide useful learning signals.

However, it remained unclear which tasks benefti most from alignment with human perceptual judgments; different tasks may demand representations that encode different levels of granularity and semantics. Here, we fine-tune modern backbones, pretrained on different tasks, on human perceptual judgments [18] and subsequently investigate which downstream tasks benefit. We develop a better understanding of how perceptual alignment affects performance on important tasks \u2013 e.g., segmentation, depth estimation, RAG \u2013 which may in turn inform future model training and data curation decisions across different applications. By evaluating competency at downstream tasks, we quantify what these representations capture and make decodable, enabling a better understanding of the human-aligned feature space. While we probe representations in terms of competency, understanding them in terms of their mechanism is a rich direction for future work. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "We find widespread beneftis from perceptual alignment across both image- and patch-level tasks. At the global level, performance consistently improves for retrieval-augmented generation, countingbased and instance-based retrieval. Moreover, propagating the supervision from image-level similarity judgments to ViT patch tokens improves performance on dense prediction tasks (semantic segmentation and depth prediction). Since model performance is closely linked to data scale, we also ablate the choice of perceptual dataset. While fine-tuning on NIGHTS \u2014 a dataset of mid-level perceptual judgments \u2014 leads to improvements across various tasks, fine-tuning on triplets from ImageNet [10], BAPPS [61], and THINGS [23] preserves or deteriorates transfer performance. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Why does fine-tuning on NIGHTS in particular lead to improvements? We hypothesize that the variations found in BAPPS and THINGS are solely high- or low-level, whereas the mid-level distortions in NIGHTS cover salient features that humans use when making inferences about what they see; these characteristics include style, pose, color, and count (see Fig.15), and largely correlate with the characteristics a model must successfully extract for many computer vision tasks. Previous work [18] found that models fine-tuned on NIGHTS seem to attend to both low-level and semantic attributes. Aligning a feature space to these concepts may be useful for visual tasks requiring both visual and semantic knowledge, such as retrieval, counting, segmentation, etc. This hypothesis may also explain why tuning on NIGHTS hurts performance on fine-grained tasks, in which perceptually similar images may belong to different categories. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Limitations. Perceptual alignment does not appear to improve performance for standard image classification tasks such as natural image datasets in the VTAB benchmark [60] (see Tables 5a-b in the Appendix). This is surprising in light of recent findings that demonstrate downstream task improvements in image classification tasks for human-aligned representations [42]. Although it is hard to pinpoint the exact cause, we hypothesize two reasons: First, perceptual judgments at different levels of abstraction may be helpful for different downstream tasks. While the mid-level perceptual judgments in NIGHTS boost performance for retrieval-based and dense prediction tasks, they may not impart a useful inductive bias for standard image classification tasks; high-level semantic associations could simply be better suited for these kinds of tasks. Alternatively, the visual features that humans use to judge similarity may not be appropriately captured in classification accuracy metrics. Some VTAB datasets have numerical ground truth in which the distance from the correct answer is meaningful; thus, it may be ill-suited for classification, and better suited to continuous evaluations, which we report in sections of the paper. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Additionally, a key insight from our dataset ablations is that not all human preferences improve performance. Finetuning on perceptual datasets with solely high-level (THINGS) or low-level (BAPPS) variations hurts performance for many downstream tasks (Section 4.5 and A.2). Similarly, Muttenthaler et al. [43] recently discovered that finetuning vision models on THINGS can hurt downstream task transfer. Due to our evaluation of the synthetically-pretrained SynCLR [55], we attribute the drop in performance to perceptual alignment. Furthermore, by ablating the number of fine-tuning steps in Section A.2, we show that overfitting to perceptual judgments may also harm downstream performance. ", "page_idx": 9}, {"type": "text", "text": "Societal impacts. Beyond our findings, there are other possibilities for harm outside the scope of the type of perceptual annotations we have studied: Human preferences may reflect unwanted biases. A long-standing problem in both language and vision is that biases (e.g. gender, racial) reflected in Internet language/images are inherited by large models, and reflected in their embeddings. One can imagine similar phenomena to happen in visual preferences [29]. Humans may disagree on a preference label, or even disagree with themselves if asked at different points in time. This may lead to noisy data if not filtered carefully, thus harming representations [54, 43]. Without sufficient demographic diversity in the annotator group, emerging biases may be reflected in the model. For example, some RLHF-trained language models have been shown to develop a bias towards the opinions of high-income, liberal individuals over their non-RLHF counterparts [49].
