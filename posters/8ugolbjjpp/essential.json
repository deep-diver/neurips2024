Solving these problems with **differential privacy (DP)** guarantees is critical for protecting sensitive data, but existing methods often focus on simple Euclidean spaces. This limits their practical use because many applications exist in non-Euclidean spaces, such as those arising in federated learning and distributionally robust optimization.\nThis research addresses these issues by developing new differentially private algorithms for SSPs and SVIs. The algorithms leverage a novel technique called **recursive regularization**, which involves repeatedly solving regularized versions of the problems, with progressively stronger regularization. This innovative method allows for achieving near-optimal accuracy guarantees in lp/lq spaces while maintaining DP. The research also develops new analytical tools for analyzing generalization, leading to optimal convergence rates for solving these problems efficiently in a variety of settings.", "affiliation": "Ohio State University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "8ugOlbjJpp/podcast.wav"}
