Current contrastive learning methods improve model discriminability but lack fine-grained information needed for pixel-level tasks. This paper introduces a novel Multi-view Masked Contrastive Representation Learning (M\u00b2CRL) framework to address these issues.\n\nM\u00b2CRL employs a multi-view masking strategy with frame-aggregated attention guided tube mask for global views and random tube mask for local views. This, combined with contrastive learning, generates representations with both fine-grained perception and holistic discriminative capabilities. The framework was pre-trained on seven publicly available datasets and fine-tuned on three, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across classification, segmentation, and detection tasks.  This work shows a promising direction for self-supervised pre-training in medical image analysis.", "affiliation": "Xiangtan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "1M67AdMBbg/podcast.wav"}
