Existing methods struggle with accurate calculations, particularly for formulas involving interventions and conditioning.  **Pearl's autonomy assumption in CBNs, while intuitive, often leads to imprecise probability estimates.**\n\nThis paper introduces a novel approach that leverages simple yet realistic independence assumptions to precisely estimate probabilities in CBNs. **By assuming independence of mechanisms determining interventions, the researchers derive unique probability estimates for interventional formulas.**  Importantly, these estimates can be calculated using observational data, significantly reducing reliance on costly and often infeasible experiments. The paper also presents simplified formulas for counterfactual probabilities, enhancing the usability of causal inference techniques.", "affiliation": "Cornell University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Causality"}, "podcast_path": "DC28Fpk76s/podcast.wav"}
