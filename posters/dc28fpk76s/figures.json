Consider the CBN M* with the following dag:", "description": "This figure shows a simple Bayesian network with four binary variables. Variable U is an exogenous variable and its values determine the conditional probabilities of the other variables. X1 and X2 are endogenous variables. The variable Y is a child of both X1 and X2. This CBN illustrates the concept of causal relationships and is used to provide examples of calculating probabilities in Bayesian Networks.  The values assigned to the variables (0 or 1) represent possible states of the system, and the conditional probabilities are specified in the text associated with the figure.", "section": "3.2 Independence of cpts and complete combinations of conditional events"}]
