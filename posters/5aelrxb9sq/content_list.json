With the gradual display of the advantages of neural network technology in signal processing, learning-based radar signal interpretation is becoming a research hot-spot and made great progress. And since radar semantic segmentation (RSS) can provide more fine-grained target information, it has become a more concerned direction in this field. However, the temporal information, which is an important clue for analyzing radar data, has not been exploited sufficiently in present RSS frameworks. In this work, we propose a novel temporal information learning paradigm, i.e., data-driven temporal information aggregation with learned target-history relations. Following this idea, a flexible learning module, called Temporal Relation-Aware Module (TRAM) is carefully designed. TRAM contains two main blocks: i) an encoder for capturing the target-history temporal relations (TH-TRE) and ii) a learnable temporal relation attentive pooling (TRAP) for aggregating temporal information. Based on TRAM, an end-to-end Temporal-Aware RSS Network (TARSS-Net) is presented, which has outstanding performance on publicly available and our collected real-measured datasets.

These components are additionally condensed into the received echoes, which is inherently a gap in understanding of radar signals to human perception, as opposed to visible light images, which are modalities aligned with human visual perception, and natural language texts that are naturally based on human semantic understanding.

Therefore, 3DConv has become the preference for RSS models that require spatio-temporal encoding capabilities [14, 21, 33, 6]. However, due to the limitation of LRF, it cannot achieve temporal-dependence across long-term range while retaining efficient computation and appropriate parameter amount.

The key to Transformer\u2019s success lies in self-attention (SA) mechanism. However, its problem is also with SA.

Generally, the models that explicitly consider the temporal dynamics in radar signals, e.g., TMVA-Net [21], can obviously achieve better performance than other convolution-based models [20, 28, 2, 14, 6]. By introducing SA mechanism in Transformers [30, 18] into convolution frameworks, TransRadar [5], T-RODNet [13] (the RD scores are not provided in the literature) and TransRSS [36] (the code is not public in the literature) further enhance the representation ability in spatial dimension, thus pushing the performance of RSS to a new height. However, due to the explosion of parameter scale caused by the high-dimensional radar tensors, none of them use SA in temporal domain.

Unfortunately, its RA performance is not so prominent, as the RA data does not change much over time or poor angular resolution, resulting in less obvious temporal information that can be exploited.

That is to say, temporal modeling only plays a limited role in these works. However, in this work, we dedicate to this temporal information utilizing problem, and attempt to define a general learning paradigm: capturing temporal relations first and then aggregating them by a task-driven manner. These relations are extracted from target frame and its historical neighbors in an explicit way, then a learnable relation aggregator would estimate the importance of those relations and group them adaptively into a single representation according to the task.

Despite the advantages of these methods, directly using RNN and SA would introduce other problems. For RNNs, the dependencies between elements are captured by a recursive dependency calculation manner. That is to say, to produce an output, $\\mathbf{O}_{t}$ at $t$ -th frame, the former one $\\mathbf{O}_{t-1}$ should be generated first. Such recursive dependency encoding mechanism could not fully enjoy the convenience of parallel computing. For SA, the dependencies between elements are captured across each pair of elements in the input sequence. However, extracting all context relations could cause redundancy. Since our task is to make prediction on target frame, it is reasonable to pay more attention to target-history pairs instead of each pair. Moreover, SA is more friendly to MLP-based frameworks, but for convolutional networks, its multi-scale spatial encoding capacity would be restricted to some extent since there is a trade-off between information compression and parameter scale when flattening the spatio-structured feature maps into a vector. Comparatively speaking, the proposed TRAM module well overcomes the above shortcomings.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
