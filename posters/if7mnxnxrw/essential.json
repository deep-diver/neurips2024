This limits their application in long sequences.  Alternative architectures like linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) offer potential solutions, but lack a unified understanding of their shared principles and differences. This hinders rigorous comparison and efficient model design. \nThis research introduces the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF) to address these issues.  DSF provides a common representation for these architectures, enabling rigorous comparisons and revealing novel insights. For example, it details conditions under which linear attention and SSMs are equivalent, and when softmax attention can be approximated.  Empirical validations further support these theoretical findings, showcasing the DSF's potential to guide the development of future efficient and scalable foundation models.", "affiliation": "ETH Zurich", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "iF7MnXnxRw/podcast.wav"}
