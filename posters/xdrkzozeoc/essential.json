Current methods like diffusion models are powerful but slow.  The core issue is the time-consuming iterative sampling process required for generating high-quality solutions.\nThis paper introduces Fast T2T, which employs an 'optimization consistency' training protocol. This clever method teaches the model to directly map noisy data to optimal solutions.  Fast T2T achieves significantly faster solution generation while maintaining solution quality.  Extensive experiments on well-known problems (Traveling Salesman Problem, Maximal Independent Set) demonstrate Fast T2T's superior performance over existing techniques, achieving speedups of tens or even hundreds of times.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "xDrKZOZEOc/podcast.wav"}
