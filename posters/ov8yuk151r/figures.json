It consists of two main modules: a retrieval module and an LLM agentic ranking module. The retrieval module uses a fine-tuned text embedding model to retrieve high-likelihood core citations. The LLM agentic ranking module employs a three-agent workflow (Guider, Analyzer, Decider) to rank the retrieved papers based on implicit relationships revealed through one-shot reasoning, enhancing accuracy and scalability to 100K candidate papers. The curriculum finetune procedure for the retrieval module is also detailed, showing a two-stage process that starts with distinguishing core citations from non-citations and then progresses to ranking core, superficial, and non-citations.", "section": "3 Methods"}, {"figure_path": "OV8YUk151r/figures/figures_6_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Illustration of the proposed hybrid language model (HLM-Cite) workflow.", "description": "This figure illustrates the HLM-Cite workflow, which consists of two main modules: a retrieval module and an LLM agentic ranking module.
