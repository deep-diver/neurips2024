Existing spectral GNNs, while using linear filters that commute with graph functional shifts, lose this property due to non-linear activation functions. This limitation affects the model's ability to learn effectively from graph data with symmetries. \nThis research introduces nonlinear spectral filters (NLSFs) designed to address this limitation. NLSFs are built using novel analysis and synthesis techniques that fully respect graph functional shifts. This design achieves full equivariance, leading to improved model performance. The method introduces a new transferable spectral domain, which significantly enhances generalizability and performance across various benchmark tasks.", "affiliation": "Viterbi Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Technion", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "y8P633E5HQ/podcast.wav"}
