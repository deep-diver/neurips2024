However, existing methods often suffer from inefficiency, inconsistency, and poor generalization. They either use tile-based approaches that merge patches, leading to high computational cost, or employ inaccurate pseudo-labels that cause fuzzy boundaries. This paper addresses these issues.  The proposed Self-Distilled Depth Refinement (SDDR) framework models depth refinement as a noisy Poisson fusion problem that considers local inconsistency and edge deformation noises.  It leverages self-distillation to obtain more accurate pseudo-labels for training, improving model robustness and resulting in significantly improved accuracy and edge quality.  The edge-based guidance with edge-guided gradient loss and edge-based fusion loss helps enforce robustness against the noises, achieving significant improvement in accuracy and efficiency. This new model outperforms existing methods on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating its robustness and efficiency.", "affiliation": "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "nEqU0iCa0s/podcast.wav"}
