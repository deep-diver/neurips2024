Existing methods often use artificial labels or rely on lossy compression, leading to suboptimal performance.  This creates a critical need for efficient, lossless techniques that can handle the scale and complexity of modern datasets without compromising accuracy.\n\nThis research introduces Random Cycle Coding (RCC), a novel, theoretically optimal method that addresses these issues. RCC cleverly encodes cluster assignments using cycles within a permutation of the data elements, thereby implicitly representing the clusters.  **The method requires no training data, has quasi-linear time complexity, and consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of storage efficiency and computational cost.** This approach is demonstrated to yield substantial space savings (up to 70%) in vector databases for similarity search applications.", "affiliation": "University of Toronto", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "XkvNQPDFqV/podcast.wav"}
