Given a query vector, FAISS returns a set of the $k$ -nearest neighbors [Lloyd, 1982] available in the database under some pre-defined distance metric (usually the L2 distance). Returning the exact set requires an exhaustive search over the entire database for each query vector which quickly becomes intractable in practice. FAISS can instead return an approximate solution by performing a two-stage search on a coarse and fine grained set of database vectors. The database undergoes a training phase where vectors are clustered into sets and assigned a representative (i.e., a centroid).
