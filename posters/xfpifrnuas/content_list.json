Our CoVer combined with ASH-S can achieve better OOD detection performance, which verifies the effectiveness of our method with an average multi-dimensional estimated confidence score. In Table 2, we provide the results compared with VLM-based OOD detection methods, which are classified into two groups: fine-tuning methods that require extra data for fine-tuning CLIP and zero-shot methods that require no training. Our method CoVer consistently achieves better performance across the four OOD datasets, aligning with the analysis that OOD and ID data are better distinguished under the expanded dimensions.

While fixing the detection models, we replace each of their OOD scores with our CoVer score. Then we integrate the proposed CoVer into several VLM-based OOD detection methods.

This ability is vital in safety-critical areas [5], where incorrect predictions due to unexpected inputs can lead to severe consequences. For instance, in the field of autonomous driving, OOD detection helps the system recognize and react appropriately to novel scenarios not covered during training, such as new road signs or altered traffic conditions due to construction. This is imperative as it prevents autonomous vehicles from making potentially hazardous decisions based on learned but now irrelevant data, thereby enhancing their safety and robustness in dynamic environments.

This specialization may inadvertently limit the representational dimensions for detection, complicating the identification of subtle OOD samples. For effective OOD detection, it is crucial to not only improve empirical performance through enhanced OOD discriminative representations but also to address this pervasive issue within the general scoring framework. Our new scoring framework leverages expanded input dimensions and utilizes a confidence score expectation to address these concerns, which also shares similar intuitions with some related work [43] in adversarial defense via random transformation.

First, our method indeed faces several failure cases. When CoVer utilizes certain severe corruption types (e.g., Spatter, Elastic transform), its performance is worse than with single input. This is because these types are more severe compared to others, leading to excessive damages to semantic features. Effective corruption types are those only perturb non-semantic features, which generally exist at the high-frequency level, resulting in different confidence variations between ID and OOD data. Notably, except for leveraging the validation set, our approach lacks a standardized criterion for selecting the types and intensities of corruptions, which is essential for uniform effectiveness across various scenarios. Additionally, the expansion of input dimensions, though beneficial for detection accuracy, may lead to increased evaluation times. These limitations highlight areas for potential improvement, particularly in balancing detection capabilities with computational efficiency. Despite these challenges, the enhanced detection capabilities our method introduces mark a significant step forward in the reliability of machine learning models against OOD inputs.

To this end, we propose a new scoring framework, namely, Confidence aVerage (CoVer), which simultaneously considers the original and expanded input dimensions. Adopting a simple but effective average operation, CoVer can capture the dynamical discrimination of OOD samples and better enhance the separability of ID and OOD distributions. We have conducted extensive experiments to present its effectiveness and compatibility with different methods. We hope our work can draw new insights from a different view on OOD detection.

There has been an increasing interest in OOD detection since the phenomenon of overconfidence in OOD data was first discovered in [38]. As a formal benchmark for OOD detection, [23] proposed using softmax prediction probability as a conventional baseline method. Afterward, numerous approaches have been developed to address visual OOD detection, which can be classified into two categories, i.e., post hoc scoring mechanism and training-time regularization [59, 58]. Post hoc methods are dedicated to exploring a better OOD score by freezing the model\u2019s parameters. ODIN [29] improves the previous MSP [23] by scaling with the temperature and slightly perturbing the inputs. Mahalanobis introduces the Mahalanobis distance in the feature space to measure the confidence score. Energy [30] exploits the energy function [27] to distinguish ID and OOD data. Both ReAct [45] and DICE [46] are improved from Energy, ReAct by feature clipping, and DICE by discarding the most prominent weights in the fully connected layer. ASH [1] designs an extremely simple method that removes a large portion of an input\u2019s activation and adjusts the rest. On the other hand, training-time regularization methods exploit the potential access to partial OOD data during model training. MOS [24] groups all classes and introduces an extra class to each group to reformulate the loss function during training. VOS [17] enhances the quality of the energy score by creating synthetic virtual anomalies. CIDER [34] exploits KNN [47] to boost OOD detection performance through the optimization of contrastive loss. DAOL [53] alleviates the OOD distribution discrepancy by crafting an OOD distribution set that contains all distributions in a Wasserstein ball centered on the auxiliary OOD distribution. The presence of outliers leads to superior performance compared to training without outliers, as evidenced by numerous previous studies [3, 25, 2, 16, 62].

Following MCM, some works fine-tuned CLIP\u2019s image encoder for visual OOD detection [48, 36]. NPOS [48] utilized generated OOD data to optimize the ID-OOD decision boundary. LoCoOp exploited the portions of CLIP\u2019s local features as OOD features to realize OOD regularization. Some latest methods [52, 26] boosted OOD detection by adding extra clues obtained from negative textual information.

In a similar vein, RainProof [11] introduced a relative information projection framework and a new benchmark called LOFTER on text generators, considering both OOD performance and task-specific metrics. Building on the idea of information projection, REFEREE [40] leveraged I-projection to extract relevant information from the softmax outputs of a network for black-box adversarial attack detection. On the other hand, APPROVED [41] proposed to compute a similarity score between an input sample and the training distribution using the statistical notion of data depth at the logit layer. HAMPER [9] introduced a method to detect adversarial examples by utilizing the concept of data depths, particularly the halfspace-mass (HM) depth, known for its attractive properties and non-differentiability. Furthermore, TRUSTED [8] relied on the information available across all hidden layers of a network, leveraging a novel similarity score based on the Integrate Rank-Weighted depth for textual OOD detection.

In contrast, through a simple but critical average operation, CoVer generally achieves better ID-OOD separability. This phenomenon can be attributed to two main reasons.

Secondly, as illustrated in Figure 2 and Figure 3, the data lies in the originally overlapped part of the ID and OOD distributions, i.e., unconfident ID data and overconfident OOD data, demonstrate significant differences in the variation of confidences under the same corruption.

Firstly, for confident ID data, the changes in confidence post-corruption can manifest as either minor or abrupt. For example, in the image in row 1, column 1 (ILSVRC2012_val_00020025), the corruption results in only a negligible loss of the semantics of the ID category present in the foreground. Conversely, for the image in row 2, column 1 (ILSVRC2012_val_00044407), the corruption enhances disturbances from non-semantic areas, leading to a loss of model confidence. Nevertheless, by averaging the original and corrupted confidence scores, the confident ID data remains stable within a higher confidence interval, demonstrating the superiority of CoVer\u2019s mechanism. Secondly, for unconfident ID data, due to the presence of ID semantic features, the model exhibits resilience in its confidence when subjected to corruption. For instance, the image in row 4, column 1 (ILSVRC2012_val_00022503) shows the model\u2019s resilience, as it continues to focus on the foreground regions belonging to the ID category despite various degrees of corruption, thus maintaining its confidence score unaffected. The same results can also be seen in row 3, column 1 (ILSVRC2012_val_00048997) and row 4, column 2 (ILSVRC2012_val_00020119).

This phenomenon is apparent because, unlike ID data, OOD images inherently lack semantic information about ID categories, leading to the disappearance of areas with high feature activation under the same type and severity level of corruption. For instance, the image in row 2, column 1 (f_formal_garden_00003688) demonstrates that regions highly responsive in their original state become irrelevant after corruption, resulting in the confidence mutation. This shift further confirms that the model\u2019s overconfidence in them is primarily due to misleading non-semantic features, such as textures and styles. Similar results can also be found in other OOD datasets, such as the image in row 3, column 1 (sun_arsrlxiznzlekfvg), and the image in row 4. column 2 (wrinkled_0070). However, the confidence of unconfident ID data, comparable to that of these overconfident OOD samples, remains stable. Consequently, by averaging the confidence scores before and after corruption, CoVer effectively captures the distinctions between OOD and ID data that initially overlap, thus enhancing the separability of ID and OOD distributions. Furthermore, for unconfident OOD data, due to their overall low relevance to ID semantics, the confidence scores consistently remain in a lower range (like the image in row 5, column 1, named 1b0ac86be7f53fd9058646315ed17269).

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.
