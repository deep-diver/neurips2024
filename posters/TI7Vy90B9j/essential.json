Current methods often rely on averaging strategies which can lead to additional computational cost and challenges.  Previous payoff perturbation techniques have helped but suffer from slow convergence or require careful tuning of perturbation parameters. \n\nThis paper introduces GABP, a novel algorithm that enhances payoff perturbation by dynamically adjusting the perturbation strength and accelerates convergence rates.  It shows that GABP achieves significantly faster last-iterate convergence compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms.  Furthermore, the algorithm exhibits competitive performance even when the data is noisy, making it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners alike.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "TI7Vy90B9j/podcast.wav"}
