The table shows the accuracy, AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve), and inverse background acceptance rate (1/\u0454B) for each model.  Two different signal acceptance rates (\u0454s = 0.5 and \u0454s = 0.3) are considered.  The best performing model for each metric is highlighted in bold.  The results for the L-GATr model are averaged over five different random seeds to show the standard deviation.", "section": "4.2 Top tagging"}, {"figure_path": "X34GKv8sYT/tables/tables_8_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: Benefit of Riemannian flow matching for generative models. We show the negative log likelihood on the tt + Oj test set (lower is better).", "description": "This table compares the negative log-likelihood (NLL) values for two different generative models trained using different probability paths.  The first model uses Euclidean paths, while the second uses Riemannian Flow Matching (RFM) paths. The RFM model significantly outperforms the Euclidean model in terms of NLL, suggesting a substantial improvement in the data efficiency and sampling quality.  Lower NLL values indicate a better fit to the data.", "section": "4.3 Generative modelling"}]
