These are used, for example, to study emotional stability after medical treatment or the development of academic ability during secondary education [1\u20133]. However, existing frameworks face several interrelated limitations. First, there are strong reasons to believe that standard taxonomies may over-generalize, failing to distinguish between related psychological phenomena that often differ in etiology, symptoms, and biological processes between individuals [e.g., 1, 4], and this may lead to inaccuracy when making predictions [5]. A related issue is that measurement models are rarely individualized, instead assuming that (1) the correlation between latent traits of interest and survey responses are invariant across individuals and (2) the relationship between the latent traits themselves are the same for everyone. Lastly, current models are almost always developed for cross-sectional data that are collected only once from each respondent, which overlooks any potential dynamics of psychological processes.

First, recent work has proposed an idiographic approach that builds a completely distinct taxonomy for each individual [6\u20138].

A second line of research focuses on building dynamic psychometric models of time-series data via some variant of item response theory [9, 10, 3], longitudinal structural equation modeling [11\u201313], vectorized autoregression [14, 15] and/or Gaussian process (GP) latent trajectories [16\u201318]. However, all these models adopt the nomothetic approach, assuming that the responses of all individuals share an identical latent structure. Finally, there is a smaller body of work that adopts intermediate approaches to create individualization while maintaining group commonality [e.g., 19].

We leverage the Gaussian process coregionalization model based on multi-task kernels to conceptualize responses of grouped survey batteries, adjusted to non-Gaussian ordinal data, and utilize IPGP for hypothesis testing of domain theories. Methodologically, our approach combines Gaussian process latent variable models (GPLVM) [20], Gaussian process dynamic systems (GPDM) [17, 18] and GP ordinal regression for Likert-type survey data [21, 22]. Despite involving latent variables and GPs, IPGP differs from GPLVM in two ways: (1) it optimizes the factor loading matrix while marginalizing the latent variables, and (2) it accommodates categorical data using a non-Gaussian ordered probit likelihood.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
