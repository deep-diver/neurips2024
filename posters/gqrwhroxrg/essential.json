However, NeRFs are computationally expensive and produce inaccurate geometry, leading to suboptimal detection performance. This paper introduces MVSDet, which uses plane sweeps for geometry-aware 3D object detection. Unlike NeRF-based methods, MVSDet does not require a large number of depth planes for depth prediction; instead, it uses a probabilistic sampling and soft weighting mechanism to select multiple depth proposals for each pixel.  This greatly reduces computational costs and improves efficiency. \nTo further enhance depth prediction accuracy and detection performance, MVSDet integrates pixel-aligned Gaussian splatting.  This technique regularizes depth prediction and improves the quality of depth estimations. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and ARKitScenes datasets demonstrate MVSDet's superiority, showcasing significant improvements in detection accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "GqrWhROxrG/podcast.wav"}
