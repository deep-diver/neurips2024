This paper delves into the nature of effective generative denoising in neural networks, highlighting the consistent dynamic property of the intrinsic residual unit.  It proposes a unified and massively scalable framework called Neural-RDM,  incorporating learnable gated residual parameters that conform to generative dynamics. \n\nNeural-RDM introduces a simple yet meaningful change by introducing a series of learnable gated residual parameters.  The framework's effectiveness stems from its ability to adaptively correct network propagation errors and approximate the mean and variance of the data. Rigorous theoretical proofs and extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements in generated content fidelity, consistency, and large-scale training capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art results on image and video generative benchmarks.  The introduction of continuous-time ODEs and adjoint sensitivity methods provide further theoretical insights into the model's stability and scalability.
