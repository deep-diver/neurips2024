The AUROC is a measure of the effectiveness of each method in distinguishing between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples.  The table compares the performance of several methods, including a single model, deep ensembles with and without hyperparameter diversification, naive versions of Agree to Disagree (A2D) and DivDis, and the proposed Scalable Ensemble Diversification (SED)-A2D method.  Two different uncertainty estimation methods (Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and Predictive Diversity Score (PDS)) are used. The results show that the SED-A2D method, particularly when using the PDS score, provides superior OOD detection performance across various datasets.", "section": "4.4 OOD Detection"}]
