The ranks of these blocks are determined by the permutation matrix P.  The illustration shows a GS(I, P, I) matrix with matrix R having 2 blocks and matrix L having 4 blocks, and visually demonstrates how the low-rank block structure arises from the interaction of the block-diagonal matrices and the permutation. Each colored block represents a low-rank block matrix, and it's shown how the elements are combined based on the permutation.", "section": "3 GS-matrices"}, {"figure_path": "7EQx56YSB2/figures/figures_5_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Illustration of P(k,12) permutations for k \u2208 {3,4,6,2}.", "description": "This figure illustrates four different permutation matrices, denoted as P(k, 12), where k takes on the values 3, 4, 6, and 2. Each matrix represents a permutation of 12 elements. The visual representation uses nodes and arrows to depict how each element is mapped to its new position after the permutation.

The number of connections from one layer to the next (b) determines the density and structure of the resulting matrix.
