This memorization can severely limit a model's ability to generalize to unseen data, impacting its real-world applicability. Existing memorization detection methods are inadequate for complex VLMs due to their multi-modal nature and rich training data.  This lack of effective measurement tools makes it difficult for researchers to assess and mitigate the risks associated with deploying such models.\nThis paper introduces a new technique called \"d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu memorization\" to accurately measure memorization in VLMs by examining whether a model retains detailed information about training images beyond what can be inferred from simple correlations.  The researchers demonstrate this technique's effectiveness on various VLMs and datasets, showcasing that memorization is prevalent even at large scales. They also propose mitigation strategies like text randomization, showing its effectiveness in reducing memorization while preserving performance.  This work significantly contributes to developing safer and more reliable VLMs.", "affiliation": "Meta", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "SFCZdXDyNs/podcast.wav"}
