Current machine learning methods struggle due to a scarcity of labeled training data.  This limitation makes it hard to accurately predict the binding of aptamers to proteins. This research aims to overcome these challenges by developing an unsupervised method for predicting these interactions.\nThe researchers introduce FAFormer, a novel deep learning model based on a transformer architecture. This model leverages predicted pairwise contact maps between proteins and nucleic acids to estimate binding affinity.  FAFormer achieves higher accuracy in contact map prediction than previous methods and demonstrates exceptional speed, making it suitable for large-scale analysis. In real-world tests with several protein-aptamer datasets, FAFormer proves highly effective at identifying strong binding candidates, thereby offering a significant advancement in aptamer screening.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Unsupervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "Xngi3Z3wkN/podcast.wav"}
