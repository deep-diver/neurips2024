Both types of work generally lead to large costs in training or synthesis. To reduce the cost, based on open-source available texts, we propose an efficient way that trains a small LLM for math problem synthesis, to efficiently generate sufficient high-quality pre-training data. To achieve it, we create a dataset using GPT-4 to distill its data synthesis capability into the small LLM.

Thus, we should guarantee the knowledge coverage and usefulness of the instances within the KD dataset.

To further improve the capability of LLMs on special tasks or domains, existing work mainly focuses on optimizing the following aspects: (1) prompt engineerings such as chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought [20, 21]; (2) continual pre-training on a domain-specific or task-specific corpus, improving the model to deal with downstream tasks [5, 7, 8, 22, 23]; (3) supervised fine-tuning, which involves fine-tuning the model on related instruction datasets, enhancing LLMs to follow special task instructions [24, 25]; (4) other strategies including RLHF [26], tool augmentation [27], decoding optimization [28] and et al.

For pre-training, existing work [5, 7, 9, 37, 38] collects a large-scale math-related corpus and continually pre-training open-source LLMs on it. Supervised fine-tuning methods focus on using relatively less high-quality data for training the LLM, which are typically math-related instructions [10, 12, 39]. Recent studies show that the complexity of mathematical reasoning demands high-quality instruction pairs, leading to reliance on advanced LLMs like GPT-4 for data synthesis [6, 40, 41].

Besides, KPMathDSMath-7B and MAmmoTH2 also perform well. Concretely, KPMath-DSMath-7B is trained on nearly 1M synthetic math problems produced by GPT-4, and MAmmoTH2 also utilizes the GPT-4, Mixtral- $\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\cdot8\\times7\\mathbf{B}$ , and Qwen-72B to extract and refine the problems existing in the webpages. The acquired problems can greatly improve their performance in math problem solving. In our approach, we also utilize synthetic math problems to train our JiuZhang3.0-7B and 8B models. Differently, our used synthesis model is a much smaller 7B LLM, which has been trained by distilling the data synthesis capability from GPT-4. Thus, it can guarantee the quality of the synthetic data, and helps JiuZhang3.0 models perform the best across most of the dataset. The higher quality also reduces the data amount requirement for pre-training. Owing to our designed high-value data selection strategy, we can also reduce the times of invoking GPT-4 API for knowledge distillation. As noted in Figure 1, the total cost of our approach is nearly only $20\\%$ of the compared baselines, indicating its efficiency.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).   \n(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.

On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
