Existing approximation methods often lead to overconfidence or biased hyperparameter selection. This work introduces Computation-Aware Gaussian Processes (CaGP), addressing the limitations of existing methods.  \nCaGP incorporates computational uncertainty into the model, providing more reliable uncertainty estimates even with approximations.  A novel training loss is proposed for hyperparameter optimization, leading to linear-time scaling. Experiments on large datasets demonstrate that CaGP significantly outperforms existing methods, showcasing its ability to efficiently handle large-scale GP training while maintaining accuracy and reliable uncertainty estimates.", "affiliation": "Columbia University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Gaussian Processes"}, "podcast_path": "tDvFa5OJyS/podcast.wav"}
