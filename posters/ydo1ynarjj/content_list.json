However, we present the high-level descriptions below for readers interested in more insights: The complexity added by independent noise levels is in the temporal dimension. Therefore, we first adopt a standard technique for video diffusion models - image pre-training, to abstract away the complexity of the image pixels themselves. Then the complexity left is temporal prediction only. We then take the pre-trained image-only model and continue training it on video data. It turns out the sampling result of Diffusion Forcing with fewer training steps in this second stage is already better than that of full-sequence diffusion at convergence. We speculate that the better result is due to the same data-augmentation effect described in prior works [39]. This shows that the overhead added by independent noise is well-warranted when considering the overall training compute (including image pre-training).

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
