Previous attacks [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] are limited to single obstacle scenarios due to their obstacle-dependent patches. In contrast, the most significant advantage of AdvRM is obstacle-agnostic. This allows AdvRM to induce an MDE model to predict a false depth for any obstacle that appears in front of it, thereby being more suitable for complex multi-obstacle scenarios. Moreover, AdvRM strategically places unobtrusive patches on the road, exploiting the road dependency phenomenon we discovered in various mainstream MDE models, thereby making AdvRM both interpretable and applicable across different MDE models.", "description": "This figure compares the proposed Adversarial Road Marking (AdvRM) attack with previous patch-based attacks on Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) models.  The top half shows that previous methods are limited to single obstacles and rely on obstacle-specific patches, which limits their effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. The bottom half illustrates how AdvRM leverages the road dependency of MDE models, placing patches on roads that affect the depth perception of any obstacle within the lane, making it more effective and robust against various MDE models.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "satH8Evs2y/figures/figures_4_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 2: Saliency maps of different MDE models.
