Householder Transformation-based Adaptor (HTA) outperforms existing methods by dynamically adjusting adaptation matrix ranks across layers, improving efficiency and performance.", "takeaways": ["A novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, HTA, for Vision Transformers is proposed.", "HTA dynamically adjusts adaptation matrix ranks across layers, improving flexibility.", "Experiments demonstrate HTA's superior performance and efficiency compared to existing PEFT methods."], "tldr": "Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of large Vision Transformers (ViTs) is challenging due to the high computational cost of full fine-tuning. Existing PEFT methods often employ low-rank adaptation matrices with fixed bottleneck dimensionality, limiting flexibility. This inflexibility hinders optimal adaptation across various layers and tasks.  These limitations restrict the model's ability to effectively adapt to downstream tasks while keeping the cost low. \nThis paper introduces a novel PEFT approach, the Householder Transformation-based Adaptor (HTA), inspired by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). HTA uses Householder transformations to construct orthogonal matrices, significantly reducing the number of parameters needed. Unlike existing methods, HTA learns diagonal values in a layer-wise manner. This enables flexible adaptation matrix ranks, accommodating layer-wise variations and enhancing performance.  The effectiveness of HTA is demonstrated through experiments on standard downstream vision tasks, showcasing its superior performance and parameter efficiency compared to other state-of-the-art PEFT methods.", "affiliation": "College of Information and Control Engineering, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "BOtjMacACI/podcast.wav"}
