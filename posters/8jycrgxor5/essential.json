Traditional methods struggle to scale, particularly for tasks like training data attribution (TDA), Hessian spectral analysis, and intrinsic dimension calculation. These limitations prevent deeper understanding of these complex models.\nThe paper introduces novel, hardware-optimized sketching algorithms (AFFD, AFJL, QK) with theoretical guarantees to efficiently address these memory bottlenecks.  Experiments show that these new methods improve scalability for TDA and Hessian analysis. Furthermore, the study reveals that pre-trained language models may have much higher intrinsic dimensionality than previously thought, especially for generative tasks.  The analysis of the Hessian spectra provides further insights, challenging commonly held assumptions.", "affiliation": "Google DeepMind", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "8jyCRGXOr5/podcast.wav"}
