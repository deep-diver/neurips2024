This paper tackles this challenge by studying gradient-variation OCO under generalized smoothness, a more realistic condition correlating smoothness with gradient norms.  Existing gradient-variation OCO methods often require prior knowledge of curvature which is not always available.\nThe authors extend the classic optimistic mirror descent algorithm to handle generalized smoothness and propose a novel Lipschitz-adaptive meta-algorithm for universal online learning. This algorithm excels at achieving optimal gradient-variation regret bounds for convex and strongly convex functions simultaneously, without needing prior curvature information.  It incorporates a two-layer structure for handling potentially unbounded gradients and ensures second-order bounds for effective base-learner ensembling.  The study also showcases its practical application in achieving fast convergence rates in games and stochastic extended adversarial optimization.", "affiliation": "National Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, China", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "V75gAxpW40/podcast.wav"}
