In this paper, we aim to learn the optimal policy capable of effectively balancing multiple short-term and long-term rewards, especially in scenarios where the long-term outcomes are often missing due to data collection challenges over extended periods. Towards this goal, the conventional linear weighting method, which aggregates multiple rewards into a single surrogate reward through weighted summation, can only achieve suboptimal policies when multiple rewards are related. Motivated by this, we propose a novel decomposition-based policy learning (DPPL) method that converts the whole problem into subproblems. The DPPL method is capable of obtaining optimal policies even when multiple rewards are interrelated. Nevertheless, the DPPL method requires a set of preference vectors specified in advance, posing challenges in practical applications where selecting suitable preferences is non-trivial. To mitigate this, we further theoretically transform the optimization problem in DPPL into an $\\varepsilon$ -constraint problem, where $\\varepsilon$ represents the minimum acceptable levels of other rewards while maximizing one reward. This transformation provides intuitive into the selection of preference vectors. Extensive experiments are conducted on the proposed method and the results validate the effectiveness of the method.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
