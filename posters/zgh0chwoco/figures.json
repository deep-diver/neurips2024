[{"figure_path": "zgh0ChWocO/figures/figures_7_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 1: Comparison of two methods with different missing ratios {0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5} on JOBS", "description": "This figure compares the performance of the proposed DPPL method and the linear weighting method on the JOBS dataset under different missing ratios (0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5) for balancing short-term and long-term rewards.  For each missing ratio, the plot shows the average welfare change (Delta_W) achieved by each method across ten different preference vectors. The x-axis represents the index of the preference vector and the y-axis represents the welfare change, which reflects the effectiveness of the methods in balancing multiple objectives.  The results demonstrate the superiority of the DPPL method over the linear weighting method in terms of achieving higher welfare change, particularly under higher missing ratios.", "section": "4 Experiments"}]
