Current methods often fail or generate artifacts, especially when dealing with complex objects or novel views.  This paper focuses on addressing the issue of manipulating articulated objects in real images.  Existing image editing techniques struggle with this due to their reliance on directly editing 2D images or relying on precise 3D models which are difficult to create for all object types. This leads to weird artifacts and limitations in manipulation capabilities. \n\nThe proposed Part-Aware Diffusion Model (PA-Diffusion) tackles this challenge. **PA-Diffusion uses Abstract 3D Models to represent articulated objects**, allowing for efficient and arbitrary manipulation. **Dynamic feature maps are introduced to transfer the appearance of objects accurately from input to edited images**, while also generating novel views or parts reasonably. **The model's effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments**, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.  The integration of the PA-Diffusion model with 3D object understanding tasks for embodied robots further highlights its versatility and strong potential for various applications.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "WRd9LCbvxN/podcast.wav"}
