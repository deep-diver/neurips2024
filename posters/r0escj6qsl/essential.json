Hybrid approaches integrating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers aim to combine the strengths of both, but often face design challenges and suboptimal performance.  Existing hybrid models frequently approximate attention mechanisms or lack optimized macro-architectures, leading to compromises in speed and accuracy. \nAsCAN tackles these issues by introducing a simple yet effective asymmetric architecture. It strategically distributes convolutional and transformer blocks across different network stages, employing more convolutional blocks in earlier stages for spatial feature extraction and more transformer blocks later for global context understanding.  This design leads to significant improvements in inference speed and a superior performance-latency trade-off, demonstrated on tasks like image classification, segmentation, and large-scale text-to-image generation. The research also presents a multi-stage training approach that improves training efficiency.", "affiliation": "Snap Inc.", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "r0eSCJ6qsL/podcast.wav"}
