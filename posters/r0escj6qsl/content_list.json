Such tensor operators include reshape, permute, concatenate, stack, etc. While these operations do not increase MACs, they burden the accelerator with tensor rearrangement. The cost of such rearrangement grows with the size of the feature maps. Thus, whenever these operations occur frequently, the throughput gains drop significantly. For instance, MaxViT [31] uses axial attention that includes many permute operations for window/grid partitioning of the spatial features. Similarly, SMT [79] includes many concatenation and reshape operations in the SMT-Block. It reduces the throughput significantly even though their MACs are lower than AsCAN (see Appendix Tab. 7).   \n\u2022 MACs do not account for non-linear accelerator behavior in batched inference. Another issue is that MACs do not account for the non-linear behavior of the GPU accelerators in the presence of larger batch sizes.

Instead, one should benchmark at larger batch sizes to see consistency between architectures.   \n\u2022 Lack of efficient CUDA operators for specialized building blocks. Many architectures propose specialized and complex attention or convolution building blocks. While these blocks offer better MACs-vs-performance trade-offs, it is likely that their implementation relies on naive CUDA constructs and does not result in significant throughput gains.

Similarly, RMT [81] computes the Manhattan distance between the tokens in the image. It includes two separate attention along the height and width of the image.

We refer to this distribution as asymmetric, in the sense that it favors more convolutional blocks in the early stages with a mix of few transformer blocks, while it reverses this trend favoring more transformer blocks in the later stages with fewer convolutional blocks.

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.   \n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.   \n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

We cite these resources in the work. For the T2I experiments, we use first party and licensed datasets. We depict this entire process in Fig. 6. We start by collating all these data sources to create a stream of images and if available, relevant text captions. Next stage, we add a series of filters to improve the quality of the selected images (resolution, de-duplication, aesthetic score, nsfw filtering, etc.). Since this data most contains very short description or almost non-existent description of the image, we unify the captioning process using an image captioning model. We collect a subset of 200K data for human annotations, where we ask the annotators to add details such as the <angle shot of the image>, <image background information>, <human attributes>, etc. We use this labelled data to fine-tune a BLIP2 model which is used to generate long captions similar to this format.
