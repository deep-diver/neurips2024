This leads to incomplete and inaccurate knowledge representation.  The variable arity and order of entities in n-ary relations further complicate the construction process. \n\nThis paper introduces Text2NKG, a novel fine-grained n-ary relation extraction framework. It employs a span-tuple classification method with hetero-ordered merging and output merging to address the challenges of variable arity and entity order.  Text2NKG supports four NKG schemas, showcasing its flexibility.  Experimental results demonstrate that Text2NKG significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance.", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Information Extraction"}, "podcast_path": "V2MBWYXp63/podcast.wav"}
