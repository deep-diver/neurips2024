However, its theoretical underpinnings remain incomplete. This lack of theoretical understanding hinders the development of more efficient and targeted sequence models.  Prior research has focused on proving the Transformer's universal approximation property, but has not investigated its approximation rate, a key factor in evaluating its efficiency and comparing it to alternative approaches.\nThis research addresses this gap by focusing on the approximation rate of the Transformer architecture. The authors introduce novel complexity measures that encapsulate both pairwise and pointwise interactions among input tokens.  Using this framework, they derive a Jackson-type approximation rate estimate, which reveals the structural characteristics of the Transformer. This analysis not only helps to understand the types of sequential relationships that Transformers excel at approximating but also facilitates a concrete comparison with other methods like recurrent neural networks, providing valuable insights for future advancements in sequence modeling.", "affiliation": "CNRS@CREATE LTD", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "ZwS2y21mZV/podcast.wav"}
