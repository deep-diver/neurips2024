The comparison between the baseline and Ti-FAD models illustrates the effectiveness of our approach in improving detection accuracy across various unseen classes. Ti-FAD demonstrates substantial performance improvements over the baseline model, particularly in action categories that involve common sub-actions (e.g., Running). This indicates Ti-FAD\u2019s enhanced capability to capture and focus on discriminative sub-actions while effectively suppressing irrelevant background information. For instance, in the PoleVault category, Ti-FAD achieves an AP of $77.23\\%$ , significantly higher than the baseline\u2019s $59.63\\%$ . Similarly, in the LongJump category, Ti-FAD\u2019s AP is $79.58\\%$ , compared to the baseline\u2019s $48.12\\%$ . In the Diving category, Ti-FAD shows an impressive AP of $79.61\\%$ , compared to the baseline\u2019s $62.78\\%$ . For Shotput, Ti-FAD achieves an AP of $42.72\\%$ , outperforming the baseline\u2019s $30.42\\%$ . These results illustrate Ti-FAD\u2019s robustness and effectiveness in dealing with unseen action categories, showcasing its ability to generalize better in zero-shot scenarios. Furthermore, we provide additional per-unseen class AP results for 20 classes of ActivityNet v1.3 compared with our cross-modal baseline in Fig. C. We observe that sharing common sub-actions between multiple classes also occurs on ActivityNet v1.3. For example, actions such as Painting, Cleaning sink, Washing face, Cleaning windows, Hand car wash, Cleaning shoes, Ironing clothes, Hand washing clothes, and Washing dishes share the common sub-action part Wiping motion with hands, leading to similar issue. These results demonstrate that the common sub-action bias issue is not isolated to THUMOS14.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \nWhile NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions   \nto provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the   \ncontribution.
