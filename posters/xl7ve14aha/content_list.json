Similar to existing regularized adaptive methods, the subproblem for computing the update direction of RAMDA involves a nonsmooth regularizer and a diagonal preconditioner, and therefore does not possess a closed-form solution in general. We thus also carefully devise an implementable inexactness condition that retains convergence guarantees similar to the exact versions, and propose a companion efficient solver for the subproblems of both RAMDA and existing methods to make them practically feasible. We leverage the theory of manifold identification in variational analysis to show that, even in the presence of such inexactness, the iterates of RAMDA attain the ideal structure induced by the regularizer at the stationary point of asymptotic convergence. This structure is locally optimal near the point of convergence, so RAMDA is guaranteed to obtain the best structure possible among all methods converging to the same point, making it the first regularized adaptive method outputting models that possess outstanding predictive performance while being (locally) optimally structured. Extensive numerical experiments in large-scale modern computer vision, language modeling, and speech tasks show that the proposed RAMDA is efficient and consistently outperforms state of the art for training structured neural network.

A challenge with such gigantic neural network models is their vast number of model parameters, reaching hundreds of billions, resulting in expensive storage and inference. It thus becomes crucial to find ways to exploit structures in trained models to reduce their spatial and prediction costs without degrading the prediction performance. An active line of research is to explicitly add a nonsmooth regularization term to the training objective function and apply proximal stochastic (sub)gradient methods, with or without a diagonal preconditioner for adaptiveness, to induce a pre-specified type of desirable structure in the final model [49, 51, 9]. Unfortunately, although the added regularizer indeed induces some desirable structures at the stationary points of the training objective function, the iterates of these methods only converge to those stationary points asymptotically, but never really attain such a point at any iteration. Therefore, whether the output model of these algorithms, which is also an iterate that is only close enough to a stationary point, indeed possesses the ideal structure at the nearby stationary point is unknown, and theoretical analyses of these algorithms do not cover any guarantees regarding the obtained structure. Indeed, [16] oberserd empirically that the structures obtained by those methods are highly suboptimal and unstable over iterations. They then proposed a regularized dual averaging method called RMDA, and proved that after a finite number of steps, the iterates of RMDA can stably identify the locally optimal structure induced by the regularizer at the stationary point of asymptotic convergence.1 This is up to our knowledge the only method with such structure guarantees for training structured neural networks. With this property, their experiments demonstrated that their method also empirically outperforms existing methods on modern computer vision tasks. However, since RMDA does not incorporate adaptiveness and their experiments are conducted only on medium-scale image classification problems, its usefulness beyond computer vision is in doubt.

The transformer is also gaining prominence in computer vision for achieving exceptional performance [29]. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to devise methods that attain satisfactory performance for training these network architectures with structure. For such modern architectures, adaptive methods like Adam [20] that iteratively rescale the stochastic gradient update directions via a coordinate-wise/diagonal preconditioner are known to outperform their non-adaptive counterparts and thus considered state-of-the-art [10, 1, 52, 28, 22]. It is hence expected that the non-adaptive RMDA of [16] might not lead to promising results for such widely-used architectures and tasks. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "This work aims to fill this gap to propose a practical regularized adaptive method with guarantees for both convergence and structure identification. Since RMDA already has structure guarantees, it might look like we just need to combine it with an arbitrary preconditioner for adaptiveness. However, this seemingly easy extension actually requires deliberation in two aspects. First, except for few exceptions, combination of even a simple diagonal preconditioner and a nonsmooth regularizer makes the training subproblem complicated with no closed-form solution. This is totally different from adaptive methods with no regularization, whose subproblem optimal solution can be easily computed by coordinate-wise divisions. Therefore, in the regularized case, the best we can hope for is to apply an iterative approach to approximately solve the subproblem. This calls for careful design and control for the measure and the degree of the inexactness in the approximate subproblem solution. The second aspect is the need of an appropriate preconditioner that provides not only outstanding empirical performance but also desirable theoretical properties. The interplay between the inexactness and the preconditioner makes it particularly difficult to address the following three challenges simultaneously. (i) Convergence: Proving convergence of a new algorithm with even just one added component is always a nontrivial task. For example, although convergence of SGD has been well-studied for decades, similar guarantees for its adaptive correspondence, Adagrad, is not established until very recently [8]. We are dealing with both a preconditioner that changes the whole algorithm, just like from SGD to Adagrad, and the inevitable inexact subproblem solutions that could nullify many useful properties (regarding the subdifferential) commonly used in convergence proofs. (ii) Structure: Theoretical guarantees for structure identification is another critical aim of this work. Inexactness alone already makes this goal dificult; see Example 1 of [24] for a simple instance such that even infinitesimal inexactness could hinder structure identification. Even without inexactness, finding a preconditioner that leads to structure identification guarantees is already dificult because no adaptive algorithm, even in the much simpler deterministic and exact setting, is known to have such a guarantee. (ii) Subproblem solver: Our goal is a practical algorithm, so we need to solve the subproblem efficiently. This requires the inexact measure be checkable and the degree quickly attainable by a well-designed solver, and the preconditioner should make the subproblem well-conditioned and cannot complicate the computation of the solver. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "To tackle these difficulties, we start from considering structure identification. We leverage the theory of manifold identification in variational analysis and nonlinear optimization to design a method that leads to finite-iteration structure identification guarantees. As discussed by [37, 16], the key to such guarantees for stochastic algorithms is to ensure the variance in the stochastic estimations decreases to zero. Due to the standard practice of data augmentation in deep learning, the training loss in the objective function is essentially the expected value of the training loss over a certain probability distribution instead of a finite sum. We thus draw inspirations from [25, 16] to consider a dual-averaging-type approach [32, 47] with momentum to attain variance reduction in this setting for the stochastic gradient estimation. However, we also need variance reduction for the preconditioner, so we carefully select a preconditioner whose update is in a manner similar to dual averaging, and prove that its variance also decreases to zero. We then conceive an implementable and practical subgradient-norm-based inexactness measure compatible with the structure identification theory. Further requirements are then added to the inexactness degree and the preconditioner to ensure convergence, and we also safeguard the preconditioner to keep the subproblems well-conditioned and the computation simple. We then propose to solve the subproblem by a proximal gradient (PG) solver that provably achieves our inexactness requirement efficiently. This leads to our Regularized Adaptive Momentum Dual Averaging (RAMDA) algorithm. ", "page_idx": 2}, {"type": "text", "text": "We summarize our main contributions as follows.

Our method is motivated by [16] that adapted the famous regularized dual averaging [47, 25] approach with momentum to train structured neural network models with data augmentation. They selected dual averaging for the gradient estimation to achieve variance reduction for structure guarantees, but their algorithm does not allow for adaptiveness. Inspired by this approach, we also take dual-averaging-like updates for the diagonal preconditioner in the subproblem for adaptiveness. Our preconditioner design also borrows ideas from the empirically successful MADGRAD of [7] for training non-regularized neural networks. RAMDA can thus also be seen as a generalization of MADGRAD to the regularized setting. Since no regularizer is present, unlike RAMDA, the subproblem of MADGRAD has a closed-form solution and no structure is expected. Moreover, [7] only analyzed convergence rates of the objective value when the problem is convex. Our analysis of (i) variance reduction in the preconditioner, (i) convergence in the nonconvex nonsmooth regularized case, and (ii) structure identification guarantees are novel and closer to properties desirable in practice. The first two items are also applicable when no regularizer is present, so our theory also expands guarantees for MADGRAD.

Other than RMDA, there are several works on training structured neural networks through regularization and its proximal operator, but none have structure guarantees. [49] considered a simple regularized SGD method with momentum, but their convergence analysis is only for the nonadaptive case. [51] studied a general regularized adaptive framework ProxGen that incorporates diagonal preconditioners, and showed that the subgradient of the objective function can decrease to the reciprocal of the batch size, but their result does not guarantee further convergence to stationary points. Moreover, they do not allow inexactness in the subproblem, so their framework can be realized for only a small class of problems. [9] proposed ProxSSl that extends ProxGen to the case of group-sparsity regularizers, whose corresponding subproblem indeed has no closed-form solution. They applied the Newton-Raphson method to obtain nearly-optimal subproblem solutions, and proposed a seemingly mild inexactness condition. Unfortunately, their condition is not checkable, and their corresponding convergence guarantee requires the regularizer to be locally smooth around each iterate, which excludes most regularizers that induce meaningful structures. On the other hand, we will show that with our implementable inexactness condition, ProxGen still possesses the same convergence guarantees in [51] without any additional requirement on the regularizer. Moreover, we will see in Section 6 that the time cost of the subproblem solver of ProxSSl is prohibitively high. ", "page_idx": 3}, {"type": "text", "text": "Structure and Manifold Identification.

[25, 37, 16] have leveraged this tool to show manifold identification for various stochastic algorithms, and the common key, as pointed out by [37], is variance reduction.

Terminate when the subproblem objective improvement is small (early stopping). For the former, we set the maximum to 10o. For the latter, we terminate PG early if $(Q_{t}(Z^{j-1})-Q_{t}(Z^{j}))/(|Q_{t}(Z^{j}|+1)<10^{-8}$ is reached. Moreover, to ensure incorporation of the preconditioner into ProxGen, we set its minimum PG iterations to 2.
