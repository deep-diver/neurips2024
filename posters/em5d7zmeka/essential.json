They neglect the inherent sparsity of 3D structures and fail to fully utilize geometric relationships between 3D points and 2D images. This results in limitations on resolution and quality.  This paper tackles these issues by introducing a new approach. \nThe proposed GeoLRM model uses a two-stage pipeline that addresses the limitations of prior methods. The first stage uses a lightweight proposal network to generate sparse 3D points. The second stage leverages a specialized reconstruction transformer incorporating a novel 3D-aware structure and deformable cross-attention mechanisms to efficiently integrate image features and refine the geometry, thereby achieving high-quality 3D Gaussian generation.  Experimental results demonstrate that GeoLRM significantly outperforms existing models, especially for dense view inputs.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "eM5d7ZmekA/podcast.wav"}
