However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of their capabilities and limitations remains elusive. This research paper tackles this challenge by providing a rigorous theoretical analysis of DEQs, focusing on their expressive power and learning dynamics.  The paper addresses the lack of theoretical understanding about when DEQs are preferable to traditional networks.\n\nThe researchers achieve this by proposing novel separation results which demonstrate the superior expressive power of DEQs. They also characterize the implicit regularization induced by gradient flow in DEQs, offering explanations for their observed benefits. Through this analysis, they propose a conjecture that DEQs are particularly advantageous in handling high-frequency components. **These findings contribute significantly to the theoretical foundation of DEQs**, clarifying their strengths and limitations and paving the way for more efficient model design and improved generalization in various deep learning applications.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "UJ9k3j93MD/podcast.wav"}
