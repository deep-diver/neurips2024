A shorter window leads to smaller bias but larger variance in the estimation, while a longer window results in larger bias but smaller variance. The right part shows the candidates for the sliding window lengths, which are determined adaptively to manage the bias-variance trade-off effectively.

The left panel illustrates how the choice of sliding window length affects the estimation of mean rewards.  A shorter window leads to lower bias but higher variance in the estimate, while a longer window has higher bias but lower variance. The right panel shows that the algorithm considers sliding windows with doubling lengths, indicating a dynamic window size adjustment strategy that balances bias and variance according to the algorithm's needs.", "section": "3 Algorithms and Regret Analysis"}, {"figure_path": "1cXdndzkxU/figures/figures_9_1.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Regret Performance comparison between our algorithms and benchmarks.", "description": "This figure compares the performance of Algorithms 1 and 2 against UCB-TP and SSUCB benchmarks across different values of beta (\u03b2).
