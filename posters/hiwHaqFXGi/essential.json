Existing GRL approaches usually rely on random masking across the entire graph, failing to address the intricate relationships between different parts of the graph.  This entanglement hinders the accurate capture of latent structures, causing difficulties in interpretation and limiting the overall performance.\nTo overcome these limitations, this paper presents DiGGR, a self-supervised learning framework that learns disentangled latent factors and uses them to guide graph mask modeling. This method promotes the learning of disentangled representations and enables end-to-end joint learning. Extensive experimental results on various public datasets confirm DiGGR's significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in node and graph classification tasks.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Self-Supervised Learning"}, "podcast_path": "hiwHaqFXGi/podcast.wav"}
