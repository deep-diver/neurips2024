Recognizing that language is the dominant modality in MSA (Zhang et al., 2023), a specially designed Dominant Modality Correction (DMC) module employs adversarial learning and a dynamic weighted enhancement strategy to mitigate noise impacts. This module first enhances the quality of the dominant feature computed from the language modality and then integrates them with the auxiliary modalities (visual and audio) in the dominant modality based multimodal learning (DMML) module for effective multimodal fusion and classification.

Using ULGM to generate pseudo-labels as an additional supervisory signal for the models may directly enable the model to learn the relationship between different modalities. For ALMT, we believe that its Adaptive Hyper-modality Learning (AHL) module facilitates the modeling of robust affective representations. AHL mainly uses the dominant modality to compute query vectors and applies multi-head attention to query useful sentiment cues from other modalities as a complement to the dominant modality.

In addition to the presence of missing data, other factors need to be considered, such as diverse cultural contexts, varying user behavior patterns, and the influence of platform-specific features on the data. These factors can introduce additional noise and variability, which may require further model adaptation and tuning to handle effectively. 3) Tuning the hyperparameters, particularly those related to the loss functions, can be challenging and may require more sophisticated methods to achieve optimal performance.
