The challenge of video understanding in the vision language area mainly lies in the significant computational burden caused by the great number of tokens extracted from long videos. Previous works rely on sparse sampling or frame compression to reduce tokens. However, such approaches either disregard temporal information in a long time span or sacrifice spatial details, resulting in flawed compression. To address these limitations, our VideoStreaming has two core designs: Memory-Propagated Streaming Encoding and Adaptive Memory Selection. The Memory-Propagated Streaming Encoding architecture segments long videos into short clips and sequentially encodes each clip with a propagated memory. In each iteration, we utilize the encoded results of the preceding clip as historical memory, which is integrated with the current clip to distill a condensed representation that encapsulates the video content up to the current timestamp. This method not only incorporates long-term temporal dynamics into the streaming encoding process but also yields a fixed-length memory as a global representation for arbitrarily long videos. After the encoding process, the Adaptive Memory Selection strategy selects a constant number of question-related memories from all the historical memories, and feeds them into the LLM to generate informative responses. The question-related selection reduces redundancy within the memories, enabling efficient and precise video understanding. Meanwhile, the disentangled video extraction and reasoning design allows the LLM to answer different questions about a video by directly selecting corresponding memories, without the need to encode the whole video for each question. Through extensive experiments, our model achieves superior performance and higher efficiency on long video benchmarks, showcasing precise temporal comprehension for detailed question answering.

Unfortunately, this paradigm explicitly loses substantial information in the long time span. To address this limitation, [43, 42, 88] develop frame-wise compression, with LLaMA-VID [43] as a typical example. It compresses each frame into only two tokens but overlooks the inter-frame temporal dynamics which are vital in compressing temporal redundancy within videos. Besides, its question-dependent compression pipeline limits the ability to produce a general representation that can handle diverse instructions. Another line of works employ memory banks [77, 7] to store history information [66, 22].

The core idea behind the memory-propagated streaming encoding is to preserve representative spatial cues and temporal dynamics while reducing temporal redundancy in videos. To achieve this goal, we segment the long video into multiple short clips and sequentially encode each clip. When encoding each clip, we first refer to the encoded results of its preceding clip as historical memory, then concatenate it with the current clip features and feed them into a small decoder-only language model [20]. Due to its autoregressive nature, the information of the sequence naturally accumulates to the last few tokens [38, 34]. Consequently, we take these last few tokens as an updated memory that encapsulates the video information up to the current timestamp. Through this streaming encoding, we explicitly take long-term temporal relations into consideration and maintain a fixed-length memory to represent an arbitrarily long video. ", "page_idx": 1}, {"type": "text", "text": "However, this fixed-length memory inevitably loses detailed information, especially in early contexts. To address this problem, we store the historical memories of all clips and select a constant number of subsets that are closely related to the question. To accomplish this, when streaming encoding each clip, we additionally append a summary token at the end of the sequence as a clip indicator that summarizes the clip contents within one token. Then, given a specific question, we concatenate the condensed memory from the final iteration with the question and pass it through the same small language model used in streaming encoding. We take the final token as the question indicator and calculate its similarity with all historical clip indicators, the clip indicator with higher similarity means its corresponding memory is more related to the question.

In the first stage, we empower a small language model with the single-clip encoding capability by a specialized prefix task. In the second stage, it serves as the streaming encoder and we jointly train it with the LLM for long video understanding. Due to the lack of long video QA data, we manually constructed a set of long video QA pairs in two ways. On the one hand, we concatenate short videos from existing datasets [76, 81] into longer ones, where the original questions correspond to different segments. On the other hand, we curate a subset of Panda-70M [11] which includes captions for segmented clips as well as the original long videos, and use this to create multi-round long video QA pairs with explicit timestamps.

To harness the full potential of LLMs, a series of works [55, 57, 13] adopt supervised instruction tuning [74] to guide models towards generating more natural and contextually relevant responses.

To facilitate long video content analysis and ensure computation efficiency, MCViT [7], MovieChat [66] and StreamingCaption [89] rely on handcrafted rules like clustering to compress the history into a finite-length memory and iteratively update it in video streams. A potential drawback is that the memory cannot be optimized through the extensive video caption data. It is potentially more promising to learn comprehensive memory consolidation in a data-driven manner. More recently, [32, 27, 87] use language as a bridge for long-term video understanding. They first divide a long video into short clips, generate textual descriptions for each clip, and then employ an LLM to aggregate the short captions for long video analysis. However, this architecture cannot be trained end-to-end, and the long video understanding quality depends on the short clip captions.

Specifically, LLaMA-VID [43] compresses each frame into two tokens, which are then combined with movie subtitles as input to an LLM. MovieLLM [68] further incorporates more generated data in training. These approaches largely rely on the texts for movie understanding, and only using visual frames leads to dramatic performance drop. Moreover, its frame-wise compression is dependent on specific questions. The model has to reprocess the entire movie to extract visual features for different questions, resulting in a high inference latency of over 10 seconds per question. Conversely, our architecture requires only once streaming encoding to obtain a general condensed representation and adaptively selects significantly fewer tokens as input to LLM to answer specific questions.

Typically, the historical memory significantly improves global understanding. This verifies our intuition that leveraging historical memory enables the model to produce a global representation that summarizes the entire video. Meanwhile, since we select a small portion of the encoded results from the long video as input to LLM, the propagated memory across clips increases tolerance for imperfect temporal selection, as it preserves previous contexts. Without memory, there would be a strict requirement on temporal selection accuracy to avoid completely losing necessary details, thus degrading the performance. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Memory Selection. We also validate the effects of our memory selection strategy. Comparing the results in Table. 8 with respect to temporal selection, we have two observations. First, for breakpoint mode needing detailed understanding of specific moments, the lack of temporal selection leads to dramatic performance drop. It is crucial to select the related clips otherwise the LLM cannot catch the necessary details. Second, the historical memories in streaming encoding process enable the encoded results from the final iterations to provide coarse summarization of the entire video. Whereas, as shown in Fig. 4, the beginning of the movie contains crucial cues for global understanding. Directly feeding the memories of final clips without temporal selection into LLM still results in information loss. These phenomena demonstrate the necessity of our adaptive selection for gathering detailed information over the long time span, which facilitates more accurate and informative responses. ", "page_idx": 8}, {"type": "text", "text": "Sampling Strategy. In default, we use clip-based sampling to segment a video into clips each consisting of a fixed number of frames.

Table 9 showcases the comparison between clip-based sampling and frame-based sampling at 1 FPS, and presents the average number of sampled frames on each dataset. The overall performance is close, which verifies that our model can well generailze to different scenarios. And on the longer MovieNet-QA videos, the frame-based sampling performs slightly better, as the clip-based approach limits the maximum number of clips, resulting in fewer total sampled frames for very long videos.

Besides, we ablate the necessity of using a language model for memory consolidation. We compare our streaming encoder instantiated with partial layers of Phi-2.7B [20] with a conventional ViT-based approach, MC-ViT [7]. We compare the results on EgoSchema fullset [51] and Next-QA [79], Global and Breakpoint Accuracy on MovieChat-1K [66], as well as the number of encoder layers and parameters in Table 10. It is clear that using language reasoning to extract video memories exceeds the vision-based strategy even with fewer parameters. The reasons are twofold. On the one hand, MC-ViT updates memory according to handcrafted rules like clustering. In contrast, using language model as the streaming encoder allows us to leverage extensive video caption/QA data to guide memory consolidation in an end-to-end manner. This datadriven strategy results in more comprehensive memories that facilitate general video understanding. On the other hand, since the memory is fed into a subsequent LLM for reasoning, it is easier to align the memory generated by a language model with the input space of LLM, thus improving performance.

(1) A comparatively a small language model, Phi-2.7B [20], with different partial layers. (2) The previous layers of the large language model, Vicuna-7B [13]. Interestingly, using comparatively fewer layers of the language model leads to better results. We conjecture this is because the language model is originally trained for next token prediction. Its feature space of the final Transformer decoder layer might not align with the objective of visual content condensation. Similar to [82, 46, 17], the shallower layers might produce feature embeddings that encode richer information and serve as more comprehensive condensed video representations. Besides, under the same parameters, the smaller language model retains more layers and consistently outperforms the previous layers of Vicuna. Meanwhile, the prefix task for training the streaming encoder requires first training the entire model for next token prediction, before using partial layers in later stages. Therefore, using Phi as the streaming encoder brings another advantage in reduced computation.

Our proposed memory-propagated streaming encoding architecture segments long videos into short clips and iteratively encodes each clip in sequence. By leveraging historical memory from preceding clips, we incorporate temporal dynamics into the encoding process and produce a fixed-length memory to encapsulate arbitrarily long videos. To further augment the detailed information for handling specific questions, we develop adaptive memory selection that selects relevant timestamps based on given instructions. This approach ensures that the most pertinent historical memories are utilized for question answering, thereby facilitating detailed and informative responses. Our model achieves superior performance with substantially fewer tokens and higher efficiency on extensive long video benchmarks. We demonstrate that memories from the streaming encoding significantly enhance global video understanding, while adaptive selection results in accurate temporal grounding with respect to specific questions.

As mentioned in Section 3.4, we employ around one-tenth of long video QA pairs to provide pseudo temporal labels. We compare four training strategies: (1) Fully weakly-supervised manner without any pseudo labels. (2) Using pseudo labels to train a warm-up model, then expanding to large-scale QA pairs. (3) Mixing all long video QA data, where the model uniformly receives temporal supervision in training. (4) Training on mixed data after warm-up initialization. The results on EgoSchema [51] and Next-GQA [80] in Table 12 indicate three key points: First, warm-up training contributes to more powerful grounding ability. The sparse temporal label supervision in mixed mode is overcome by the powerful initialization from warm-up training, which can generalize to large-scale data. Second, reusing the temporal labels after warm-up offers no additional benefits, so we adopt warm-up as the default setting. Third, without using temporal labels, the grounding performance drops, but the QA accuracy remains stable. Fig. 8 reveals that compared to those trained with temporal labels, the weakly-supervised model selects relatively later segments that preserve previous contexts with the help of historical memory, thus maintaining comparable QA capacity.

We compare using different number of summarization tokens and selected timestamps, i.e., $P$ in Eq. 1 and $V$ in Eq. 3. We compare the performance as well as the number of tokens input to LLM in Table 13. We conclude three observations. First, too few summarization tokens, e.g., $P=1$ , leads to substantial performance drop, since it condenses a 16-frame into only 16 tokens with significant information loss in spatial contexts. Such information loss cannot be compensated by selecting more temporal segments. Second, the performance saturates when improving $P$ from 4 to 16. This is because the existing video benchmarks [51, 80] do not place high demands on spatial detail understanding. It is sufficient to represent each frame with 4 tokens on average. Third, increasing the number of selected timestamps only results in minor improvements, which is not proportional to the increased number of tokens. This can be attributed to the historical memory used in the streaming encoding process. The utilization of historical memory enables the condensed representation of each clip to encompass the information in preceding clips, which enlarges the temporal receptive field. Hence, increasing the number of selected timestamps does not proportionally increase the temporal receptive field, resulting in slight performance improvements.

It is obvious that the lack of time prompts leads to substantial performance drop in the MovieNet-1K breakpoint mode accuracy, which requires detailed analysis of specific moments. The reason is that the breakpoint mode requires the model to answer questions at specified timestamps, the time prompts provide the model with necessary information in adaptive selection.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
