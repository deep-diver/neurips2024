Variational Inference [3, 19] is a broad class of methods that turn this kind of inference problems into optimization programs. Given a family of tractable densities $\\mathcal{Q}$ , the goal is to find, within that family, a fine approximation $q$ of the targeted density $p$ according to a given criterion. The discrepancy between $p$ and $q$ is usually measured by the exclusive Kullback-Leibler divergence $D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(q\\parallel p)$ , for it is quite convenient to use from a computational standpoint. However, it may lead to approximations that tend to underestimate the variance of the target [27], a behavior known as zero-forcing, or mode-seeking when the variational density is unimodal. This can be highly detrimental to the quality of the posterior approximation, for instance when the target is multimodal. To overcome this difficulty, recent research has experimented with other divergence measures, such as the inclusive KL divergence $D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(p\\,\\|\\,q)$ [28], or the more general alpha-divergence family [1], for instance in [9, 15, 25]. Specifically, in [9], the authors introduced a family of iterative algorithms that perform monotonic alpha-divergence minimization, meaning that the criterion is guaranteed to decrease at each new iteration. Although numerical experiments suggested a strong potential for their method, the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm remained to be determined.

In Section 4, we explain why the empirical counterpart of this algorithm will not converge to minimizers of the alpha-divergence. Instead, we propose an alternative algorithm that has more advantageous properties. We prove its almost sure convergence, as well as a law of the iterated logarithm. Section 5 is dedicated to extending our algorithm to the training of Variational Auto-Encoders [22].

In [28, 39], the authors use Markov Chain Monte-Carlo to optimize the inclusive Kullback-Leibler divergence, and provide conditions for the almost-sure convergence of their algorithm.

VAEs have achieved notable success in separating style and content on various types of data, like images and time series. However, they may suffer posterior collapse on challenging datasets as a result of learning an entangled latent representation. Several authors have investigated ways to disentangle the latent space (see, e.g., [29]), and alpha-divergence minimization could be helpful to learn suitable latent representations. In this series of experiments, we train VAEs with a Gaussian prior to generate new images, the encoders consisting of cascades of four convolutional layers, with batch normalization and leaky ReLU activations. Similarly, the decoders are composed of four transposed convolutional layers. We set the latent dimensions to 64 on CIFAR10 and 128 on CelebA.

Still, for both approaches and on both datasets, the IWAE and VAE baselines can be outperformed with a proper choice of $\\alpha$ .

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
