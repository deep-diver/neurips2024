Two datasets, Mind and Movie, are used for evaluation.  The left panel displays the results for the Mind dataset, while the right panel shows the results for the Movie dataset. Both plots illustrate an increasing trend of Recall@20 with the increasing number of branches, suggesting that a more branched tree structure leads to better retrieval performance.", "section": "4.1.2 Insights from Generalization Bound"}]
