The x-axis represents the number of iterations, and the y-axis shows the ratio of the function value difference to the initial function value difference.  The plots illustrate the convergence behavior across various dimensions (d) and condition numbers (\u03ba). The results suggest that BFGS with B0 = LI converges faster initially, but BFGS with B0 = \u03bcI transitions to superlinear convergence sooner.", "section": "8 Numerical Experiments"}]
