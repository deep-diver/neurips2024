Here, \u03a8(\u0391) := Tr(A)d - log Det(A), Bo = +Bo and Bo = \u22072f(x*)\u00af\u00bdBo\u22072f(x*)\u00af\u00bd. The last column shows the number of iterations required to achieve the corresponding linear or superlinear convergence phase. For brevity, the absolute constants are dropped.", "description": "This table summarizes the global convergence rates achieved by the BFGS method with the Armijo-Wolfe line search under different initialization conditions.  Three cases are considered: (i) arbitrary positive definite initial Hessian approximation matrix B0, (ii) B0 initialized as the identity matrix scaled by L (B0 = LI), and (iii) B0 initialized as the identity matrix scaled by \u03bc (B0 = \u03bcI).  For each case, the table shows the convergence rate during the linear phase I, the linear phase II, and the superlinear phase, along with the number of iterations needed to enter each phase.  The rates and iteration counts depend on line search parameters, the condition number (\u03ba = L/\u03bc), dimension (d), and the weighted distance (Co) between the starting point and optimal solution. The function \u03a8(A) represents a weighted measure of the difference between matrix A and the identity matrix.", "section": "4 Global Linear Convergence Rates"}]
