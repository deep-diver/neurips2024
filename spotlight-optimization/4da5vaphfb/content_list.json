The main bottleneck of existing NOT solvers is associated with the procedure of finding a near-exact approximation of the conjugate operator (i.e., the $c$ -transform), which is done either by optimizing over non-convex max-min objectives or by the computationally intensive fine-tuning of the initial approximated prediction. We resolve both issues by proposing a new theoretically justified loss in the form of expectile regularization which enforces binding conditions on the learning process of the dual potentials. Such a regularization provides the upper bound estimation over the distribution of possible conjugate potentials and makes the learning stable, completely eliminating the need for additional extensive fine-tuning. Proposed method, called ExpectileRegularized Neural Optimal Transport (ENOT), outperforms previous state-ofthe-art approaches in the established Wasserstein-2 benchmark tasks by a large margin (up to a 3-fold improvement in quality and up to a 10-fold improvement in runtime). Moreover, we showcase performance of ENOT for various cost functions in different tasks, such as image generation, demonstrating generalizability and robustness of the proposed algorithm.

[2009], Ambrosio et al. [2003], Peyr\u00e9 et al. [2019], Santambrogio [2015]). In different works, OT is primarily employed either 1) as a differentiable proxy, with the OT distance playing the role of a similarity metric between the measures, or 2) as a generative model, defined by the plan of optimal transportation. One notable advantage of using OT in the latter setting is that, compared to other generative approaches, such as GANs, Normalizing Flows, or Diffusion Models, there is no assumption for one of the measures to be defined in a closed form (e.g., Gaussian or uniform) or to be pairwise-aligned, admitting various applications of the OT theory. Both loss objective and generative formulations of OT proved successful in a vast range of modern ML areas, including generative modelling (Arjovsky et al. [2017], Gulrajani et al. [2017], Korotin et al. [2021], Liu et al. [2019], Leygonie et al. [2019]), reinforcement learning (Fickinger et al. [2022], Haldar et al. [2023], Papagiannis and Li [2022], Luo et al.

[2022a,b]), biology and genomics (Bunne et al. [2022]). Low dimensional discrete OT problems are solved via Sinkhorn algorithm (Cuturi [2013]), which employs entropic regularization. This technique makes the entire optimization problem differentiable and efficient computationally, but may require numerous iterations to converge to an optimal solution, whereas the OT problem for the tasks supported on high-dimensional measure spaces are usually intractable, oftentimes solvable only for the distributions which admit a closed-form density formulations.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
