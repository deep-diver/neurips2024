Existing methods like FlashAttention have shown some promise in speeding up attention, but limitations persist, such as suboptimal GPU utilization. This research aims to address these limitations and improve attention computation efficiency.\nFlashAttention-3, the focus of this research, introduces three key techniques: producer-consumer asynchrony to overlap computation and data movement; overlapping softmax operations with matrix multiplication; and hardware-accelerated low-precision computation using FP8. This approach achieves a significant speedup on H100 GPUs (1.5-2x with BF16, reaching up to 840 TFLOPs/s; 1.3 PFLOPs/s with FP8), while simultaneously demonstrating improved numerical accuracy compared to previous methods.  The code is also open-sourced for community use.", "affiliation": "Colfax Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "tVConYid20/podcast.wav"}
