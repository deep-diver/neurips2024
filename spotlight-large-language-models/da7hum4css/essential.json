Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a promising approach to align LLMs with human preferences for safety, but existing methods like Lagrangian-based primal-dual optimization are computationally expensive and unstable.  This leads to a need for more efficient and reliable methods.\nThis paper proposes a novel approach called 'Constrained Alignment via dualization' (CAN), pre-optimizing a smooth dual function to transform a constrained alignment problem into an equivalent unconstrained one. This avoids the computationally expensive primal-dual iterations and improves training stability. The authors develop two algorithms based on this method: MOCAN (model-based) and PECAN (preference-based). Extensive experiments confirm the superior performance of these algorithms in terms of computational efficiency and stability while effectively improving the safety of LLMs.", "affiliation": "University of Pennsylvania", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "dA7hUm4css/podcast.wav"}
