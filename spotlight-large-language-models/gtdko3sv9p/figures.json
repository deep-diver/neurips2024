The x-axis shows the number of function evaluations (NFE), which is a measure of computational cost. The y-axis shows two different metrics: the Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) and the Inception Score. Lower FID scores indicate better image quality. Higher Inception Scores indicate better image quality.
