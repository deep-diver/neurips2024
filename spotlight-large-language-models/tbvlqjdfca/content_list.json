Due to their representation and generalization capabilities, prototype-based methods have made great progress and garnered increasing attention. However, their performance remains unsatisfactory due to encountering the challenge of low prototype quality, attributed to two reasons: 1) Semantic information constraints: Limited 3D support point clouds contain only partial and incomplete object information, lacking both intra-class diversity and interclass discriminative information. Consequently, vanilla prototypes generated from the 3D support set are insufficient to be comprehensive class descriptors. 2) Class information bias: Query and support point clouds exhibit intra-class object variations [16, 20] and feature distribution gaps [9, 10], making vanilla prototypes may be ill-suited for segmenting query samples as the distances between vanilla prototypes and query features will be far away.

Fortunately, Large Language Models (LLM) (e.g., ChatGPT) [3, 35, 29] offer promising opportunities to help achieve this goal due to their wealth of implicit knowledge and have been leveraged for a variety of downstream tasks, such as image segmentation [42] and point cloud classification [43]. Inspired by this, we leverage the capabilities of LLM to explicitly generate diverse and differentiated contents, combined with novel designs to obtain refined prototypes with richer semantics. Secondly, to reduce class information bias, previous works [9, 20, 16, 10] have endeavored to map prototypes to query feature space through prototypequery interaction using cross-attention [31]. However, noisy interactions between prototypes of one class and query features of other classes may introduce class-irrelevant cues, thereby undermining the reliability of prototypes.

Initially, vanilla prototypes are generated from 3D support features. Firstly, our GCPR prompts the LLM to generate diverse descriptions of single classes and differentiated descriptions of class pairs. Then we design text adapters and two text-to-prototype compressors for mapping and incorporating text knowledge into vanilla prototypes, yielding refined prototype covering with richer and discriminative semantic knowledge. Secondly, leveraging the refined prototypes, PCPR generates pseudo masks for query point clouds to derive the class-specific pseudo-query context, which can be aggregated into prototypes by a newly designed query-to-prototype compressor, yielding more reliable prototypes that can better associate with query points.
