Existing parameter-efficient methods primarily focus on modifying model weights, which may not be optimal.  This research introduces Representation Finetuning (ReFT), a family of methods that learn task-specific interventions on hidden representations within a frozen LLM.  This approach offers a potentially more effective way to adapt LLMs to specific tasks.\n\nThe study presents LoReFT (Low-rank Linear Subspace ReFT), a highly efficient ReFT method and its ablation DiReFT.  Evaluated across several reasoning and instruction-following tasks, LoReFT consistently outperforms other parameter-efficient techniques. **LoReFT achieves state-of-the-art results while using 15-65x fewer parameters than comparable methods.** This demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of ReFT, offering a promising new direction for LLM adaptation.", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "fykjplMc0V/podcast.wav"}
