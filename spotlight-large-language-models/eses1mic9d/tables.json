These personas are categorized into different groups based on their characteristics: religious beliefs, ethnicity, gender, political affiliation, behavioral traits, and a baseline persona.  The researchers used these personas to manipulate the model's perception of the user and observe how it impacts the model's willingness to answer adversarial queries.  The pro-social and anti-social personas and their opposites were included to explore the impact of different user characteristics on the model's safety filters.", "section": "2 User persona details"}, {"figure_path": "eSes1Mic9d/tables/tables_16_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 2: All personas.", "description": "This table lists all the personas used in the study.  The personas are categorized into two groups: Behavioral and Baseline. The Behavioral personas represent a range of personality traits and attitudes toward AI, including altruistic, selfish, law-abiding, unlawful, curious, close-minded, power-avoidant, power-seeking, AI-loving, and AI-hating. The Baseline persona represents a more neutral individual characterized by a simple preference for coffee over tea.", "section": "A User persona details"}, {"figure_path": "eSes1Mic9d/tables/tables_17_1.jpg", "caption": "Table 3: Paired t-test results for different conditions", "description": "This table presents the results of paired t-tests comparing the response rates of different persona conditions to a baseline condition.  The t-statistic and p-value are provided for each persona.  Lower p-values indicate a statistically significant difference in response rates between the persona condition and the baseline.

For each persona (e.g., Law-Abiding, Selfish, etc.) and for both refusal and fulfillment conditions, the table shows the percentage of times the model produced a response to an adversarial prompt when the steering vector was added (+1 coefficient) versus subtracted (-1 coefficient) from the model's activations. This demonstrates the effect of persona steering vectors on the model's willingness to respond to harmful queries.", "section": "2.3 Inducing refusal directly"}]
