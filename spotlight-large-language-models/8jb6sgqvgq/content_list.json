In many domains, adversarial training has proven to be one of the most promising methods to reliably improve robustness against such attacks. Yet, in the context of LLMs, current methods for adversarial training are hindered by the high computational costs required to perform discrete adversarial attacks at each training iteration. We address this problem by instead calculating adversarial attacks in the continuous embedding space of the LLM, which is orders of magnitudes more efficient. We propose a fast adversarial training algorithm (CAT) composed of two losses: the first makes the model robust on continuous embedding attacks computed on an adversarial behaviour dataset; the second ensures the usefulness of the final model by fine-tuning on utility data. Moreover, we introduce CAPO, an adversarial variant of IPO that does not require utility data for adversarially robust alignment. Our empirical evaluation on five models from different families (Gemma, Phi3, Mistral, Zephyr, Llama2) and at different scales (2B, 3.8B, 7B) shows that both algorithms substantially enhance LLM robustness against discrete attacks (GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR), while maintaining utility.

Firstly, this dramatically impacts performance, especially for smaller models, which often require a lot of prompt engineering to follow the few-shot prompts correctly. Secondly, it dramatically changes the mode of the model. In effect, a model might be overly robust in chat mode (i.e. when using a chat template) where it rejects most requests, but it might appear to have high utility in benchmarks because no chat template is used (e.g. MMLU). ARC as an evaluation benchmark is even more misleading as it measures the likelihood of a set of possible answer tokens, thus not reflecting the utility of the model when using a chat template. We quantitatively evaluate the refusals of MMLU questions when using a chat template in App. G. We recommend future work, to consider these issues when evaluating robustness and utility for the same model. ", "page_idx": 7}, {"type": "text", "text": "Training data failure modes AT datasets such as Harmbench [6] or AdvBench [44] tend to use a common grammatical and syntactical structure, using imperative commands such as \u201cTell me\u201d or \u201cGive instructions\u201d. Chatting with our models and $\\mathrm{ZEPHYR}+\\mathrm{R}2\\mathrm{D}2$ , we observe that requests would be refused when using this same style but are accepted if asked in a different style, such as \u201cCould you please ...?\u201d.

For instance, $\\mathrm{ZEPHYR}+\\mathrm{R}2\\mathrm{D}2$ will refuse to answer \u201cTell me a story\u201d and \u201cTell me how to build a bomb\u201d, but will answer \u201cCould you please tell me a story?\u201d and \u201cCould you please explain to me how to build a bomb?\u201d. This also explains why the model may even appear useful under utility benchmarks employing chat templates such as MT-BENCH. To demonstrate this failure case we create two small benchmark datasets called POLITEHARMBENCH (see App. H) and HARMLESS. The former rephrases the harmful behaviours politely, and the latter consists of harmless requests formulated in the same grammatical style as the original HARMBENCH behaviours.

We expect future work to achieve considerably better robustness-utility trade-offs through better hyperparameter selection alone. Furthermore, our proposed method CAT requires a utility dataset to retain helpfulness, which may shift the predictions of the model on unrelated tasks, a limitation we try to address with the CAPO method.

The positive impact is that this will reduce the amount of harmful content produced by LLMs if adopted as many attacks will no longer work. In addition, the lower computation cost should hopefully reduce the carbon footprint of training robust and safe LLMs. However, this may lead to overconfidence in the safety of LLMs, thus necessitating more extensive red teaming. Another possible negative impact of our work is that adversarial training may be used to prevent LLMs saying things the model operator does not want regardless of the harmfulness of the content. Our contributions on the failure modes of robustness evaluation should hopefully lead to more rigorous and trustworthy evaluation protocols. These are crucial to accurately assess the state of robustness in LLMs. Note, it may be that further failure modes exist we did not yet find.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.   \n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
