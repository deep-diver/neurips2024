However, there's a trade-off: reducing one often increases the other. Existing intermittent communication algorithms offer suboptimal performance in either sample or communication complexity.\nThis work addresses this trade-off. It first establishes fundamental limits on communication complexity, proving that achieving linear speedup in sample complexity requires at least logarithmic communication cost.  Then, it introduces Fed-DVR-Q, a novel algorithm that achieves both order-optimal sample and communication complexities, providing a complete characterization of this trade-off. This is the first algorithm to achieve this important milestone.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "6YIpvnkjUK/podcast.wav"}
